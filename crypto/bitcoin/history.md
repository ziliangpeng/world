# Bitcoin: Major History and Key Events

## Overview

Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized cryptocurrency, created in 2008 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. From its origins as a cypherpunk experiment to becoming a $2 trillion asset class embraced by Wall Street, Bitcoin has fundamentally changed the financial landscape.

**Current Status (2025):**

- Market Cap: ~$2 trillion
- Price: $108,000+ (ATH in 2024)
- Mining Reward: 3.125 BTC per block (after 2024 halving)
- Adoption: 86% of institutional investors, $92.3B in ETF inflows globally
- Total Supply: Fixed at 21 million BTC (hard cap)

## The Origins (2008-2009)

### August 18, 2008: Domain Registration
- Domain name `bitcoin.org` was registered

### October 31, 2008: The White Paper
- **Satoshi Nakamoto published "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"** on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com
- The white paper outlined a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust or central authorities
- This date is now celebrated as Bitcoin's birthday

### January 3, 2009: Genesis Block Mined
- **The Bitcoin network came into existence** when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block (block 0)
- Block reward: 50 BTC
- **Embedded message in the coinbase transaction:** "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
- This message referenced a headline from The Times newspaper about the UK government bailing out banks during the financial crisis, highlighting Bitcoin's philosophical motivation: creating an alternative to the traditional banking system

### January 12, 2009: First Bitcoin Transaction
- **First Bitcoin transaction conducted by Satoshi Nakamoto**
- Sent 10 BTC to Hal Finney, a cryptographic developer and early Bitcoin adopter
- Hal Finney was a renowned cryptographer and the first person besides Satoshi to run the Bitcoin software

## Early Development and First Value (2009-2010)

### October 2009: First Exchange Rate
- **NewLibertyStandard published the first Bitcoin exchange rate**
- 1 USD = 1,309 BTC

- **Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two Papa John's pizzas**
- First real-world transaction using Bitcoin
- Gave Bitcoin its first market value: $0.004 per coin
- Those 10,000 BTC would be worth over $1 billion at 2024 peak prices

### December 2010: Satoshi Disappears
- **Satoshi Nakamoto was last active in Bitcoin development**
- Handed over the Bitcoin source code repository to Gavin Andresen

## Bitcoin Halving Events: The Supply Schedule

Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. New bitcoins are created through mining, but the reward is cut in half approximately every four years (every 210,000 blocks). This creates a deflationary supply schedule.

### 2009-2012: Initial Reward
- **50 BTC per block**
- Total blocks: 0 - 210,000

### First Halving - November 28, 2012
- **Block reward: 50 BTC → 25 BTC**
- Block height: 210,000
- Bitcoin price at halving: ~$12

### Second Halving - July 9, 2016
- **Block reward: 25 BTC → 12.5 BTC**
- Block height: 420,000
- Bitcoin price at halving: ~$650

### Third Halving - May 11, 2020
- **Block reward: 12.5 BTC → 6.25 BTC**
- Block height: 630,000
- Bitcoin price at halving: ~$8,750

### Fourth Halving - April 2024
- **Block reward: 6.25 BTC → 3.125 BTC**
- Block height: 840,000
- Bitcoin price at halving: ~$63,000

### Next Halving - Estimated 2028
- **Block reward: 3.125 BTC → 1.5625 BTC**
- Block height: 1,050,000
- Projected price: Unknown

**Halving Impact:**

Each halving reduces the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation, slowing inflation and reinforcing scarcity. Historically, halvings have preceded major bull runs:

- 2012 halving → 2013 bull run to $1,200
- 2016 halving → 2017 bull run to $20,000
- 2020 halving → 2021 bull run to $69,000
- 2024 halving → 2024 bull run to $108,000+

## The Future of Bitcoin

### Bulls Argue:
- Fixed supply of 21M makes it superior store of value vs fiat currency
- Increasing institutional adoption legitimizes asset class
- Inflation hedge during monetary expansion
- Global, permissionless, censorship-resistant money
- "Digital gold" narrative strengthening

### Bears Argue:
- Extreme volatility makes it poor medium of exchange
- Environmental concerns over energy consumption
- Regulatory risks could limit adoption
- Competition from other cryptocurrencies and CBDCs
- No intrinsic value, purely speculative

### Key Questions for Next Decade:
- Will Bitcoin become a strategic reserve asset for nation-states?
- Can Bitcoin ETFs drive price to $500K+ as some predict?
- Will energy consumption and environmental concerns limit growth?
- How will quantum computing threaten Bitcoin's cryptography?
- Will Bitcoin remain dominant or lose to competitors?
