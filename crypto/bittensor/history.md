# Bittensor (TAO): Major History and Key Events

## Overview

Bittensor is a decentralized machine learning network founded by Jacob Steeves and Ala Shaabana, launched in January 2021. Built on the revolutionary concept of "Proof of Intelligence," Bittensor creates an open marketplace where anyone can contribute AI models and computational resources while earning TAO tokens. With Bitcoin-inspired tokenomics (21M supply cap, halving schedule, fair launch), Bittensor aims to democratize artificial intelligence and break the monopoly large corporations have on machine intelligence.

**Current Status (December 2025):**

- Market Cap: ~$3B (Ranked #47)
- Price: ~$290-310

## The Origins (2015-2020)

### 2015: The Concept
- **Jacob Steeves (ex-Google engineer) began developing fundamental concepts** for what would become Bittensor
- Vision: Create decentralized machine learning network to break corporate AI monopoly
- Inspired by Bitcoin's decentralization principles
- Goal: Democratize access to AI development and ownership

### 2016-2019: Design and Development
- **2016:** Jacob Steeves began working on Bittensor (according to LinkedIn)
- Project designed over several years
- Research into incentive mechanisms for collaborative ML
- Assembled founding team:
  - **Jacob Robert Steeves** - Co-founder, studied Math and CS at Simon Fraser University (2011-2015)
  - **Ala Shaabana** - Co-founder, PhD in Computer Science from McMaster University, Assistant Professor at University of Toronto (2020-2021)

### 2020: OpenTensor Foundation
- **OpenTensor Foundation established** to steward Bittensor development
- Non-profit structure to ensure decentralization
- Continued development of core protocol
- Prepared for mainnet launch

---

## The Fair Launch (2021)

### January 2021: Kusanagi Mainnet Launch
- **First iteration of Subtensor blockchain called "Kusanagi" launched**
- **NO ICO, NO VC allocations, NO pre-mine**
- Completely fair launch - everyone earns through network participation
- Revolutionary approach: "If you want TAO, you must contribute to the network"
- Initial participants: miners running AI models, validators evaluating quality

**Fair Launch Principles:**
- No tokens to VCs, insiders, or advisors outside network participation
- All TAO mined/validated through actual AI contribution
- Contrasts sharply with typical crypto projects (95%+ have VC pre-mines)

### May 2021: Kusanagi Halted
- **Kusanagi version halted** for improvements
- Network needed upgrades before continuing
- Team prepared for relaunch with enhanced features

### November 2021: Nakamoto Mainnet Relaunch
- **Kusanagi forked and relaunched as "Nakamoto"**
- Named after Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto
- Improved consensus mechanism
- Enhanced subnet architecture
- This is considered the "true" mainnet launch

**Initial Price:** First exchange rate detected at $0.1262 (November 2021)

---

## Tokenomics: Bitcoin-Inspired Model

### Supply Mechanics
- **Total Supply Cap: 21 million TAO** (same as Bitcoin)
- **Halving Schedule:** Every ~4 years (triggered by supply milestones, not time)
- **Initial Emission:** 7,200 TAO per day (~1 TAO per block)
- **Current Circulating Supply:** 10.45M TAO (~50% of total)

### Emission Distribution
- **82% to TAO stakers** who delegate to validators
- **18% to validators and miners** based on performance
- Rewards distributed based on Yuma Consensus algorithm

### Halving Trigger
Unlike Bitcoin's time-based halvings, Bittensor's halving is **supply-based**:
- First halving triggers when circulating supply reaches **10.5M TAO**
- Current supply: 10.45M (December 2025)
- **First halving imminent: December 12-14, 2025**

---

## Technical Innovation: Proof of Intelligence

### Core Concept
Traditional blockchains use Proof of Work (computational puzzles) or Proof of Stake (capital commitment). Bittensor uses **Proof of Intelligence**:

- **Miners submit AI outputs** (text generation, image creation, predictions, etc.)
- **Validators evaluate quality** and rank miner performance
- **High-quality AI work rewarded with TAO tokens**
- Creates marketplace for machine intelligence

### Yuma Consensus Mechanism

**How It Works:**

1. **Validators Evaluate Miners**
   - Each validator periodically submits weight vectors
   - Weights rank value of each miner's work
   - Validators stake TAO to participate

2. **Consensus Computation**
   - Yuma Consensus algorithm runs on-chain
   - Resolves validator rankings into emission vectors
   - Allocates TAO rewards to miners and validators

3. **Stake-Weighted Trust**
   - Validators with more staked TAO have stronger influence
   - Incentivizes honest, consistent evaluation
   - Validators who align with consensus earn more

4. **Protection Against Manipulation**
   - **Weight clipping:** Extreme outlier weights get clipped to average
   - Prevents collusion between validators and miners
   - Erroneous or malicious evaluations earn no rewards
   - Validators build trust through consistent, accurate assessments

**Result:** Decentralized, incentive-aligned evaluation of AI quality without central authority.

---

## Subnet Architecture

### What Are Subnets?
Bittensor's network is divided into **specialized subnets**, each focusing on specific AI tasks or data types:

- **Subnet = Incentive-based competition marketplace**
- Each subnet produces a specific digital commodity related to AI
- Miners produce the commodity, validators measure quality
- Self-contained codebase running on Bittensor protocol

### Subnet 1: Text Prompting (Flagship)
- **Most prominent subnet** in Bittensor network
- Focuses on natural language processing and text generation
- Validators generate prompts (questions/tasks)
- Miners (running LLMs) respond to prompts
- Validators evaluate response quality against reference answers
- Enables decentralized GPT-like capabilities

### Other Subnet Types
- **Image generation** - Stable Diffusion-like models
- **Financial predictions** - Market forecasting
- **Data storage** - Decentralized storage networks
- **Computational power lending** - Distributed computing
- **Code generation** - Programming assistance
- **Audio/music generation** - Sound synthesis
- **Custom mechanisms** - Subnets can have up to 2 mechanisms each

### Subnet Growth
- **32+ active subnets** as of December 2025
- Anyone can create a subnet
- Competition for subnet slots (limited to 32 initially)
- Most valuable subnets attract most miners/validators

## The First Halving Event (December 2025)

### Halving Mechanics
- **Date:** December 12-14, 2025 (supply-triggered, exact block uncertain)
- **Trigger:** Circulating supply reaches 10.5M TAO (currently 10.45M)
- **Current emissions:** 7,200 TAO per day (~1 TAO per block)
- **Post-halving emissions:** 3,600 TAO per day (~0.5 TAO per block)
- **Immediate 50% emission cut**

### Impact on Inflation
- **Current inflation rate:** ~26% annually
- **Post-halving inflation:** ~13% annually
- **Supply shock:** New TAO entering market cut in half
- **Bitcoin parallel:** Similar to Bitcoin's 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024 halvings

### Market Implications

**Bull Case:**
- Reduced supply growth creates scarcity
- Historical crypto halvings (BTC, LTC, BCH) bullish
- Anticipatory rallies common before halvings
- Grayscale: "Reduced supply + increased demand = positive catalyst"
- First halving often most impactful (2012 Bitcoin +8,000% in following year)

**Bear Case:**
- "Sell the news" event after halving occurs
- Already priced in (market knows exact supply schedule)
- Miners may sell accumulated TAO to maintain revenue
- Broader crypto market conditions matter more

**Neutral View:**
- Halving creates framework for long-term value accrual
- Short-term volatility likely
- Multi-year effect, not instant pump
