# Ethereum: Major History and Key Events

## Overview

Ethereum is the world's first programmable blockchain, created by Vitalik Buterin and launched in 2015. Unlike Bitcoin's focus on peer-to-peer money, Ethereum introduced **smart contracts** - self-executing code that runs on the blockchain - enabling decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, NFTs, and an entire ecosystem of innovation.

**Current Status (2025):**

- Market Cap: ~$410B (2nd largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin)
- Price: ~$3,420 (December 2025)
- All-Time High: $4,878 (November 10, 2021)
- Consensus Mechanism: Proof of Stake (since September 2022)
- Energy Consumption: Reduced 99.95% after The Merge
- Primary Use Cases: Smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, Layer 2 scaling

---

## The Origins (2013-2014)

### November 27, 2013: The Whitepaper
- **Vitalik Buterin published the Ethereum whitepaper** describing his vision for a blockchain platform that could run smart contracts
- Vitalik was 19 years old, a programmer and Bitcoin Magazine co-founder
- The whitepaper proposed a "world computer" - a decentralized platform for running applications without intermediaries

### December 2013: Founding Team Assembled
- **Ethereum was founded by:**
  - Vitalik Buterin (visionary and lead developer)
  - Anthony Di Iorio (funding and business development)
  - Charles Hoskinson (business and legal, later founded Cardano)
  - Mihai Alisie (operations)
  - Amir Chetrit (business development)
- Later joined by Gavin Wood (co-founder, wrote Ethereum Yellow Paper and Solidity) and Joseph Lubin (co-founder, later founded ConsenSys)

### January 2014: Public Announcement
- **Vitalik announced Ethereum publicly at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami**
- Presented the concept of a programmable blockchain to the crypto community
- Received mixed reactions - some excited, others skeptical

### June 2014: Ethereum Foundation Established
- **Established the Ethereum Foundation**, a Swiss-based non-profit organization
- Purpose: Manage legal and marketing efforts for the ICO campaign
- Switzerland chosen for favorable regulatory environment

---

## The ICO and Launch (2014-2015)

### July 20 - September 2, 2014: The ICO
- **42-day Initial Coin Offering (ICO)** to fund Ethereum development
- Raised **31,000 BTC** (worth ~$18 million at the time)
- In return for ETH tokens (1 BTC = 2,000 ETH)
- One of the first major ICOs in crypto history
- This ICO model later inspired the 2017 ICO boom (and bubble)

### July 30, 2015: Ethereum Mainnet Launch
- **Ethereum officially went live** with the genesis block
- First public release known as **"Frontier"** - experimental beta version
- Mining reward: 5 ETH per block (later reduced through network upgrades)
- Initial price: ~$2.92 per ETH
- Lowest early price: $0.4457 (October 2015)

### March 2016: Homestead Release
- **First production-ready release of Ethereum**
- Network stability improvements
- Removed "beta" experimental status
- Ethereum price: ~$12

---

## The DAO Hack and Ethereum Classic Split (2016)

### April 30, 2016: The DAO Launches
- **The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) launched** - a venture capital fund run by smart contracts
- Raised **$150 million USD worth of ETH** through a token sale (largest crowdfunding in history at the time)
- Demonstrated potential of decentralized governance
- Built on Ethereum's smart contract platform

### June 17, 2016: The DAO Hack
- **Hacker exploited vulnerability in The DAO's code**
- Drained **3.6 million ETH** (~$70 million at the time)
- The stolen funds amounted to ~5% of all ETH in existence
- Crisis threatened Ethereum's credibility and future

### July 20, 2016: The Hard Fork
- **Ethereum implemented a controversial hard fork at block 192,000**
- Purpose: Restore the stolen funds by reversing the hack
- Community divided over whether this violated blockchain's immutability principle
- **The blockchain split into two:**
  - **Ethereum (ETH)** - Accepted the hard fork, returned stolen funds
  - **Ethereum Classic (ETC)** - Rejected the hard fork, kept original chain

**Significance:** This event raised fundamental questions about blockchain governance, immutability, and decentralization. "Code is law" vs "Community governance" debate.

- **ETH issuance reduced ~90%** - from ~13,000 ETH/day to ~1,600 ETH/day
- Mining ended, validators now secure the network
- **Most significant upgrade in Ethereum's history** (arguably in all of crypto)

**Significance:** Demonstrated that a major blockchain could successfully change consensus mechanisms without disruption. Addressed environmental criticism and set foundation for future scaling.

---

## Major Network Upgrades (2023-2024)

### April 14, 2023: Shanghai/Capella Upgrade ("Shapella")
- **Shanghai (execution layer) + Capella (consensus layer) upgrades**
- **Enabled staking withdrawals** for the first time since Beacon Chain launch
- Stakers could finally withdraw their ETH locked since December 2020
- Removed major barrier to institutional staking
- Withdrawal queue system implemented to prevent mass exodus

**Impact:** Over 18 million ETH staked (worth $30B+), staking became more attractive with ability to withdraw.

## Key Controversies and Debates

### The Merge and Centralization Concerns
- Proof of Stake criticized as more centralized than Proof of Work
- Large staking providers (Lido, Coinbase, Kraken) control significant stake
- Concerns about validator centralization in certain jurisdictions

### Scalability Challenges
- Despite upgrades, Ethereum mainnet still expensive during congestion
- Gas fees can spike to $50-100+ during NFT mints or DeFi volatility
- Layer 2 solutions work but fragment liquidity and user experience

### Regulatory Uncertainty
- **SEC views on Ethereum unclear** - Is it a security or commodity?
- Post-Merge, some argue PoS makes ETH more like a security
- Gary Gensler (SEC Chair) has given mixed signals
- ETF approval suggests commodity status, but lawsuits against exchanges continue

### Environmental Impact (Historical)
- Pre-Merge Ethereum consumed ~100 TWh/year (similar to Netherlands)
- Post-Merge: 99.95% reduction, now negligible environmental impact
- Criticism largely resolved after The Merge

### Competition
- Other smart contract platforms: Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, BNB Chain
- Ethereum maintains dominance but competitors are faster/cheaper
- "Ethereum killers" have not killed Ethereum, but captured some market share

## The Future of Ethereum

### Bulls Argue:
- **Ultrasound money** - Post-Merge, ETH is deflationary in high usage periods
- **Network effects** - Largest developer community, most dApps, most liquidity
- **DeFi and NFT dominance** - 60%+ market share in both categories
- **Layer 2 scaling working** - Dencun made L2s 100x cheaper
- **Real-world asset tokenization** - Trillions in traditional assets could move on-chain
- **Institutional adoption accelerating** - ETFs, staking, corporate treasuries

### Bears Argue:
- **Scalability still limited** - Mainnet expensive, L2s fragment liquidity
- **Competition intensifying** - Solana, Base, others offer better UX
- **Regulatory risk** - SEC could classify ETH as security
- **Complexity** - Harder to use than Bitcoin, harder to explain
- **Centralization concerns** - Large staking providers control significant stake

### Ethereum's Roadmap: "The Surge, Verge, Purge, Splurge"
- **The Surge** - Scaling via rollups and sharding (100,000+ TPS target)
- **The Verge** - Verkle trees for more efficient state storage
- **The Purge** - Remove historical data to reduce node requirements
- **The Splurge** - Everything else (account abstraction, MEV, etc.)

### Key Questions for Next Decade:
- Will Layer 2s successfully scale Ethereum to billions of users?
- Can Ethereum maintain dominance as "Ethereum killers" improve?
- Will regulatory clarity emerge or will uncertainty persist?
- Can Ethereum capture trillions in real-world asset tokenization?
- Will ETH reach previous ATH of $4,878 or new highs beyond $10,000?
