# Ethereum Upgrades

This document summarizes the major upgrades for the Ethereum network, based on the official roadmap as of late 2025.

## Past Upgrades

### The Merge (Paris Upgrade)
- **Date:** September 14, 2022
- **Description:** This was a monumental upgrade that transitioned Ethereum's consensus mechanism from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) to the much more efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This reduced the network's energy consumption by approximately 99.95%.

### Shapella Upgrade
- **Date:** April 11, 2023
- **Description:** The Shapella upgrade (a portmanteau of "Shanghai" and "Capella") enabled validators to withdraw their staked ETH from the Beacon Chain for the first time. This was a critical step in providing liquidity and flexibility for stakers.

### Dencun Upgrade
- **Date:** March 12, 2024
- **Description:** The Dencun upgrade introduced "proto-danksharding" via EIP-4844. It created a new, temporary data storage mechanism called "blobs," which significantly reduced transaction costs for Layer-2 rollups, making them much cheaper to use.

### Pectra Upgrade
- **Date:** May 6, 2025
- **Description:** The Pectra upgrade (combining "Prague" and "Electra") focused on several improvements. Key features include increasing the maximum effective balance for validators (from 32 to 2,048 ETH) and introducing account abstraction (EIP-7702), which allows regular user accounts to temporarily act like smart contracts to enable features like paying for gas with tokens other than ETH.

### Fusaka Upgrade
- **Date:** December 3, 2025
- **Description:** The Fusaka upgrade focused on enhancing scalability and efficiency. It introduced Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS) to improve data availability for Layer-2s and hardened the gas limit to make block processing more predictable and stable.

## Future Upgrades

### Glamsterdam Upgrade
- **Scheduled:** 2026
- **Description:** Glamsterdam is a future planned upgrade that will introduce more advanced features like Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS) to further decentralize block production and Block-level Access Lists (BALs) to optimize transaction processing.
