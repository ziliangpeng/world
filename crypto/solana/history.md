# Solana: Major History and Key Events

## Overview

Solana is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain founded by Anatoly Yakovenko in 2017, officially launching in March 2020. Known for its breakthrough Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism, Solana aims to deliver web-scale performance with 65,000+ transactions per second and sub-second finality. Despite facing significant challenges including network outages and the FTX collapse, Solana has emerged as a major smart contract platform and a hub for DeFi, NFTs, and memecoins.

**Current Status (December 2025):**

- Market Cap: ~$99.5B (5th largest cryptocurrency)
- Price: ~$204
- All-Time High: $293.31 (January 2025)
- Transactions Per Second (TPS): 65,000+ theoretical capacity
- DeFi TVL: $11.5B+
- Daily DEX Volume: $4-5B
- Consensus: Proof of History (PoH) + Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Block Time: ~400ms (sub-second finality)

---

## The Network Outage Era (2021-2022)

Solana's rapid growth exposed critical weaknesses in network stability. The blockchain experienced **10 major outages** during its early years, primarily in 2021-2022.

### September 2021: First Major Outage (17 Hours)
- **Grape Protocol token sale on Raydium triggered network collapse**
- Automated bots swarmed the network to farm token allocations
- **Over 300,000 transactions per second** from trading bots
- Validator nodes received over 1 Gbps of raw transaction data
- Block production halted completely
- **Required coordinated validator restart** - first major crisis
- Exposed lack of congestion management mechanisms

**Significance:** First widely-publicized network failure, raised questions about Solana's reliability.

### 2022: The Year of Outages
- **14 outages in 2022** totaling 4 days, 12 hours, 21 minutes of downtime
- Solana struggled with its "beta" status and stability issues

**Major 2022 incidents:**

**January 2022:**
- High-compute transactions overwhelmed network
- Duplicate transactions flooded in, making situation worse

**April/May 2022: NFT Bot Attack**
- NFT minting bots reached **4 million transactions per second**
- Far exceeded network capacity
- Network stalled, required mainnet beta restart

**June 2022: Clock Drift Bug**
- Glitchy transaction setup caused consensus breakdown
- **Solana's on-chain clock lagged 30 minutes behind real-world time**
- Highlighted fundamental issues with clock synchronization

**Root Causes Identified:**

1. Lack of priority fees and localized fee markets
2. No proper congestion management
3. Bugs in validator client software (5 of 7 major outages)
4. Lack of client diversity
5. Beta software still maturing

### 2023: Stability Improves
- **Only 2 outages in 2023** (both in February)
- **February 25, 2023:** Malfunctioning validator node broadcast unusually large block
- Overwhelmed Turbine (block-propagation protocol)
- Several hours of degraded performance
- Network stability dramatically improved after implementing fixes

### 2024-2025: Beta Status Ending
- Near-complete network stability achieved
- "Probably nearing the end of that beta phase" - core developers
- No major outages since February 2024

---

## The FTX Crisis and Collapse (November 2022)

### Background: Sam Bankman-Fried and Solana
- **SBF was a major Solana backer** and early investor
- FTX and Alameda Research purchased **58,086,686 SOL tokens** from Solana Foundation and Solana Labs (August 2020 onwards)
- SBF became one of Solana's most prominent advocates
- Solana Foundation also invested in FTX and held millions in SBF-linked cryptos on the exchange

### November 2-11, 2022: The Collapse

- Triggered bank run on FTX
- **November 9:** SOL dipped below $13 following revelation that Alameda held large SOL positions
- **November 11:** FTX, Alameda Research, and 100+ affiliated entities filed for bankruptcy
- Federal prosecutors called it "one of the biggest financial frauds in American history"

### Impact on Solana
- **SOL crashed from ~$37 to $9.77** (74% decline)
- Existential crisis for Solana ecosystem
- Many predicted Solana would die due to FTX association
- "Solana is dead" narratives dominated media
- Ecosystem projects struggled with funding
- Developer morale at all-time low

**November 2, 2023:** Sam Bankman-Fried convicted of defrauding FTX customers and Alameda lenders

## Proof of History: Solana's Innovation

### What is Proof of History?

**Traditional blockchain problem:**
- Nodes must communicate to agree on time and transaction order
- Creates bottlenecks and limits speed

**Proof of History solution:**
- Cryptographic clock that creates verifiable passage of time
- SHA-256 hash function run sequentially
- Each hash includes previous hash output
- Creates verifiable, ordered record of events
- Nodes can verify time passage without communication

**Combined with Proof of Stake:**
- PoH provides the clock
- PoS provides the consensus
- Together achieve high throughput with security

### Technical Specs
- **Block time:** ~400ms (sub-second)
- **TPS capacity:** 65,000+ theoretical
- **Actual TPS:** Varies, typically 2,000-5,000 sustained
- **Finality:** Sub-second (compared to Ethereum's 15 minutes)
- **Transaction cost:** $0.00025 average

## Key Controversies and Challenges

### Network Reliability
- 10 major outages through 2022
- "Beta" status lasted nearly 5 years
- Centralization concerns during outages (coordinated validator restarts)
- Improved dramatically but trust damaged

### FTX Association
- Heavy association with Sam Bankman-Fried
- Solana Foundation invested in FTX
- Millions in SBF-linked cryptos held on FTX
- Near-death experience after FTX collapse
- Stigma persisted into 2023

### Centralization Concerns
- Relatively high hardware requirements for validators
- Fewer validators than Ethereum
- Large validators control significant stake
- Geographic concentration of validators

### Client Diversity
- Single validator client (unlike Ethereum with multiple)
- 5 of 7 major outages traced to client bugs
- Lack of diversity creates single point of failure
- Improvements underway but remains concern

### Memecoin Casino Reputation
- Explosion of low-quality memecoins
- Pump-and-dump schemes
- Rug pulls common on Pump.fun
- Critics say Solana became "degen casino"
- Defenders say it proves product-market fit for retail

### Environmental Efficiency (Positive)
- PoS + PoH extremely energy efficient
- Negligible environmental impact compared to Bitcoin
- One of the greenest blockchains
