# Research Report: Sakana AI — Technology, Positioning, Research Directions, and 2025 Activities

## Executive Summary

Sakana AI is a Tokyo-based AI research and engineering startup founded in 2023 by David Ha (ex-Google Brain) and Llion Jones (co-author of Attention Is All You Need). The company is one of Japan’s most visible AI organizations and—following its 2025 Series B round—has become one of Japan’s most valuable startups.

Sakana AI positions itself at the intersection of three active research areas: (1) LLM multi-agent collective intelligence, (2) evolutionary and nature-inspired AI methods, and (3) autonomous scientific discovery (“AI Scientist”). While each field exists independently in academia, Sakana AI’s unique value proposition is the integration of these lines of work into a single coherent vision: creating self-evolving, collaborative populations of AI agents capable of generating models, algorithms, and scientific insights with minimal human supervision.

As of 2025, the company remains research-first but has significantly accelerated its applied business in finance, defense, and enterprise AI within Japan. Sakana’s most substantial achievements in 2025 include new architectures (CTM, Transformer²), advanced distillation methods (TAID), multi-agent science systems (AI Scientist-v2), benchmarks (ALE-Bench, EDINET-Bench, Sudoku-Bench), product-like models (TinySwallow-1.5B), and strategic partnerships with major Japanese financial institutions.

1. Company Overview

Founding & Leadership
	•	Founded: 2023
	•	Headquarters: Tokyo, Japan
	•	Founders:
	•	David Ha — CEO, previously Google Brain
	•	Llion Jones — CTO, co-author of the Transformer paper
	•	Ren Ito — COO, ex-Mercari

Mission

Sakana AI aims to develop sustainable, efficient, and Japan-optimized AI systems based on biological principles such as evolution, collective intelligence, and ecosystem dynamics.

Strategic Position

Unlike US labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind) that build ever-larger monolithic LLMs, Sakana’s differentiator is a population-based, modular, evolutionary approach. They target:
	•	compute efficiency
	•	model diversity and self-evolution
	•	multi-agent systems
	•	Japanese-localized enterprise and sovereign AI

2. The Three Research Fields and Sakana’s Unified Direction

Sakana works across three distinct but related research domains, each of which is an established academic field:

2.1 LLM Multi-Agent & Collective Intelligence

Field focus: multi-agent collaboration, debate, tool use, coordination.
Sakana’s framing: groups of “average-IQ” agents behaving collectively like a school of fish.

2.2 Evolutionary & Nature-Inspired AI

Field focus: genetic algorithms, quality diversity, neuroevolution, model merging.
Sakana contribution: evolutionary model merging at scale; population-based model evolution.

2.3 Autonomous / Agentic Scientific Discovery

Field focus: automated hypothesis generation, experiment execution, literature review, and paper writing.
Sakana’s AI Scientist is one of the most visible implementations worldwide.

Sakana’s Unified Vision

Individually, these are three different academic fields, but Sakana combines them into one direction:

A self-evolving ecosystem of collaborating AI agents that generate new models, algorithms, and scientific discoveries.

Evolution creates diverse model populations, multi-agent systems create collective intelligence, and autonomous science provides the application domain.

This integrated framing is Sakana’s primary intellectual differentiator.

3. Product Status and Commercialization

3.1 Current Product-Like Assets

Sakana has released multiple models, benchmarks, and agent systems:
	•	TinySwallow-1.5B — a 1.5B-parameter Japanese LLM, SOTA among its size class.
	•	Continuous Thought Machine (CTM) — new architecture using neuron-level temporal dynamics.
	•	Karamaru — Edo-period language model chatbot.
	•	AI Scientist-v2 — autonomous research pipeline with workshop-accepted output.
	•	Benchmarks:
	•	ALE-Bench (algorithm engineering)
	•	EDINET-Bench (Japanese financial),
	•	Sudoku-Bench (creative reasoning)

These are real outputs but are closer to research assets than mature enterprise products.

3.2 Enterprise & Applied AI Business

In 2025 Sakana formalized its Business Development HQ and an Applied Team targeting Japan’s industrial and public-sector AI needs.

Key partnerships include:
	•	MUFG Bank (finance)
	•	Daiwa Securities Group (investment/wealth management)
	•	Hokuriku Financial Holdings (regional banking)
	•	Defense collaboration through the US–Japan Global Innovation Challenge

These indicate an early but growing commercialization roadmap.

3.3 Revenue Status

Public estimates put revenue around ~$22M USD annually, but the company has not confirmed official figures. Revenue appears to come from:
	•	enterprise R&D collaborations
	•	pilot deployments
	•	strategic partnerships
	•	potentially governmental/defense engagements

Sakana remains R&D-heavy, revenue-light, but is transitioning rapidly.

6. Conclusion

Sakana AI has had a breakout year in 2025. They are not merely a research curiosity; they are actively shaping a distinctive direction in AI based on evolutionary processes, model populations, and multi-agent collaboration. Their 2025 output is unusually broad and substantial, spanning architectures, distillation, reasoning, agentic systems, benchmarks, and partnerships.

They remain early in productization, but their applied business is accelerating, especially in finance, enterprise, and defense. Their unified vision—self-evolving ecosystems of AI agents—is still aspirational, but their technical progress in 2025 shows real execution capacity.

Sakana is best understood as a research-first frontier lab transitioning into a Japan-centric applied AI provider, with a technological worldview that sets it apart from monolithic LLM labs.
