2. **FSD Miles (Line 20)**:
   ```
   CURRENT: 📊 1+ billion real-world miles driven on FSD Beta

2. ✅ Update FSD miles to 2B+ or 3.6B+ depending on timeframe
3. ✅ Clarify FSD user count with specific quarter
4. ✅ Adjust FSD Beta initial rollout description

### Add Qualifiers:
5. Mark revenue figures as "estimated" or "analyst projections"
6. Note conflicting reports on FSD conversion rates
7. Add "(as of [date])" to time-sensitive claims

### Optional Improvements:
8. Add specific dates for "2024" claims (Q1 2024, Q4 2024, etc.)
9. Cite sources for leadership titles
10. Add references section with key sources

## 📝 OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Accuracy Rating**: 85-90%

The document is generally well-researched and accurate for historical events and major milestones. The main issues are:
- **Outdated 2024 data** (market cap, FSD miles)
- **Missing qualifiers** for estimates and projections
- **Imprecise timeframes** for "2024" claims

These are relatively minor issues that don't affect the document's core narratives about Tesla's autonomous driving approach, technical strategy, and competitive positioning.
