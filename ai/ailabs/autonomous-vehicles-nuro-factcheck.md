## ✅ WELL-QUALIFIED CLAIMS

The document appropriately qualifies many unverifiable claims as:
- "estimated"
- "company targets"
- "industry estimates"
- "analyst projections"
- "speculative"
- "not publicly disclosed"

This is good practice and should be maintained for all unverifiable numbers.

## 📝 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Add CEO correction immediately - this is a factual error about current leadership
2. Fix vehicle specification errors (R1 width, R2 length/weight)
3. Correct funding and layoff timelines
4. Consider adding "[citation needed]" or "[industry estimate]" tags to unverified market size claims
5. Add specific sources/dates where possible for partnership announcements
6. Keep current approach of clearly labeling estimates and targets as such
