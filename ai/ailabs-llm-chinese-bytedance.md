## Founding Story and History

### Zhang Yiming's Career Arc

**Background**:
- Software engineer and entrepreneur from Longyan, Fujian Province
- Studied software engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University
- Worked at Sina, Microsoft, and various startups before founding ByteDance

**Pre-ByteDance (2009-2012)**:
1. **2009**: Co-founded 99fang.com (real estate search engine) with Liang Rubo
2. **2012**: Began developing Toutiao as a recommendation algorithm-based news app

### The Toutiao Era (2012-2016): Content Discovery Revolution

**Innovation**:
ByteDance pioneered algorithmic content recommendation at scale. Instead of traditional editor-curated news or social network feeds, Toutiao used machine learning to surface content personalized to each user's preferences.

**Key Insight**:
Zhang Yiming observed that most content platforms were built around social graphs (who you follow) or editorial curation. Toutiao instead built around user interests and behavior, creating a content discovery engine.

**Rapid Scaling**:
- 2016: Toutiao became the #1 news app in China
- Users: 100+ million monthly active users
- Content creators: Millions

### The AI Lab Foundation (March 2016)

**Strategic Establishment**:
ByteDance established the ByteDance AI Lab, a dedicated research organization reporting directly to founder Zhang Yiming. This signaled the company's commitment to AI as a core competency.

**Leadership**:
- **Ma Weiying** - First director, former Executive Vice President of Microsoft Research Asia
- Built the foundation for long-term AI research while supporting Toutiao's content recommendation systems

**Focus Areas**:
- Recommendation algorithms (powering Toutiao, Douyin)
- Computer vision (video understanding)
- Natural language processing
- Speech processing

### Diversification and Global Expansion (2016-2020)

**Major Products**:
1. **Douyin** (2016) - Short-form video platform (became TikTok globally)
2. **TikTok** (2018) - Global version of Douyin
3. **Huoshan** (Huoshan Video)
4. **Xigua Video** (Medium-form video)

**TikTok's Explosive Growth**:
- 2018-2020: Became the fastest-growing social media platform globally
- Reached 1 billion users faster than any app in history
- Proved ByteDance's algorithm was globally competitive

### The AGI Era (Late 2023-Present)

**Strategic Shift Toward LLMs**:
After ChatGPT's release in late 2022, ByteDance recognized the opportunity in large language models. The company launched its dedicated AI transformation strategy:

**Key Milestones**:
