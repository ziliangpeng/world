## AI/ML Tech Stack

### CIMRL - Combining Imitation and Reinforcement Learning for Safe Autonomy

**What's unique**: Nuro developed **CIMRL (Combining Imitation and Reinforcement Learning)**, a novel framework that **decouples imitation learning and reinforcement learning** to achieve both **expert-level driving smoothness** (from IL) and **long-horizon safety reasoning** (from RL). Unlike traditional approaches that directly optimize a joint IL+RL objective (BC-SAC), CIMRL performs **motion planning using motions generated by a previously learned IL component as temporally extended actions in a hierarchical RL framework**. The architecture **reduces the complexity of the action space** to a narrow subset of top motions generated by state-of-the-art motion generators, then employs **reinforcement learning to select** among these candidate trajectories based on a **long-horizon optimization objective**. This design provides **long-horizon reasoning crucial for safe driving** while delegating **trajectory generation to IL-based models for smooth and expert-level execution**. The key innovation: **learning motion selection** rather than direct action primitives. CIMRL additionally utilizes **recovery RL within a safe RL framework** to establish safety guarantees — the system learns recovery behaviors for edge cases while maintaining bounded risk. Results demonstrate **improved collision rate over pure imitation** and **significantly better progress rate** when incorporating multiple trajectory sources. The approach trains **years of driving experience in hours** through large-scale simulation, then **deploys successfully on real roads**. CIMRL was presented at **CVPR-2024 Workshop on Data-Driven Autonomous Driving Simulation** (arXiv:2406.08878).

### FTL Model Compiler - 40% Latency Reduction Through Multi-Compiler Optimization

**What makes it different**: Nuro built **FTL (Faster Than Light)**, a **compiler framework that flexibly applies multiple industry compilers in a single compilation** within a highly customizable Python environment. Unlike systems locked to a single compiler (TensorRT, ONNX, XLA), FTL enables **selective optimization** where different model layers use different compilation strategies — **TensorRT for convolutions**, **custom CUDA/Triton kernels for specific operations**, and **in-house optimization rules for novel architectures**. Migrating a vision model from legacy compiler to FTL (using **TensorRT + custom compilation rules**) achieved **40% latency reduction**. The framework supports **custom GPU kernel injection** written in **CUDA, Triton, or Pallas**, allowing the compiler team to **pick specific implementations for specific layers** rather than accepting one-size-fits-all optimization. FTL provides a **unified optimization platform** where a single code change delivers **performance impact to all models**, accelerating iteration velocity. The autonomy stack experienced **significant reductions in CPU utilization, GPU utilization, and GPU memory consumption**, enabling deployment of Nuro's **unified multi-head vision model with multi-GPU inference**. FTL's multi-framework support enables **leveraging advanced techniques like quantization, new operators, and emerging frameworks** without vendor lock-in. For autonomous vehicles requiring **millisecond-scale reaction speeds**, FTL's optimization directly improves safety margins and enables more sophisticated perception models within computational budgets.

### Unified Perception Model - 30-Sensor Fusion in Voxel Feature Space

**What sets Nuro apart**: Nuro's **unified perception model** processes **synchronized inputs from almost 30 individual sensors** (long-range and short-range cameras, LiDAR, radar) to **simultaneously address multiple perception and mapping tasks** — detection & tracking, localization & online mapping, occupancy and flow — within a **single foundation model**. The architecture **processes sensor features independently**, then employs a **sensor fusion module** that transforms features from **native formats into a unified voxel feature space**, generating **multi-modal spatial features**. A **temporal module** aligns spatial features from T to T-n and fuses them into **spatial-temporal features**, providing historical context for prediction. This design contrasts with traditional pipelines running **separate models for each task** (object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation, tracking), requiring **re-computation of features** across models and consuming significant on-board computational resources. The unified approach **conserves compute** while **elevating system performance** through shared representations. The **foundation model architecture** is **simple, performant, and scalable**, flexible enough to integrate **diverse sensor suites** across different vehicle platforms. Sensors provide **redundant, 360° field of view** with **four camera types** (ultra-long-range, long-range, short-range, traffic light-detection) complementing LiDAR and radar for **maximum scene detection and safety**. The **self-cleaning sensors** maintain operational integrity in varying weather conditions, addressing a key autonomous vehicle challenge.

### Nuro ML Scheduler - Kubeflow-Based Distributed Training Orchestration

**What's unique**: Nuro developed the **Nuro ML Scheduler**, a custom distributed training orchestration system built on **Kubeflow** that accepts training jobs from users and ensures they **acquire resources needed to run training** across **V100, A100, H100 GPUs** and **Google Cloud TPUs**. As frameworks like **Horovod, PyTorch, and JAX** gained popularity, implementing **custom recovery for each new training strategy** would slow ML development velocity — motivating Nuro's design using **Kubeflow's open-source training operators** to **delegate framework-specific logic** while creating **abstractions** so **all core scheduling logic is shared across frameworks and accelerator types**. The scheduler reserves accelerators on GCP to **guarantee minimum availability**, critical for continuous autonomous vehicle development. The infrastructure supports **data parallelism, model parallelism, mixed precision training (FP16/FP8), and quantization methods (AWQ, AQT, GPTQ)**. The system handles **fault tolerance** automatically — if a GPU fails during multi-day training runs, the scheduler **recovers** without manual intervention. Nuro runs training across **hundreds of accelerators simultaneously**, processing **petabyte-scale datasets** from real-world driving and simulation. The ML stack's primary framework is **PyTorch**, with **JAX** for high-performance ML and **TensorFlow** for legacy models, all orchestrated through the unified scheduler. This infrastructure enables researchers to **train years of driving experience in hours** through parallelized simulation, directly feeding CIMRL's reinforcement learning pipeline.

### Licensing Business Model - Nuro Driver for OEM Integration

**What makes it different**: Nuro **pivoted from operating its own autonomous delivery fleet** to **licensing the Nuro Driver autonomy platform** to existing automotive manufacturers, enabling them to **add autonomy to their vehicles at scale**. This strategic shift positions Nuro as an **autonomy supplier** rather than vehicle operator, analogous to how NVIDIA supplies autonomous driving compute rather than building cars. The **Nuro Driver** platform integrates **proprietary hardware (sensors, compute), software (perception, planning, control), and safety systems** as a **turnkey L4 autonomy solution**. OEMs and mobility providers can integrate Nuro Driver into their existing vehicle designs (trucks, SUVs, vans) without developing in-house autonomy stacks. The **Uber partnership** demonstrates this model: **Uber purchases Lucid Gravity SUVs** and **Nuro equips them with autonomous driving technology**, with Uber operating the robotaxi fleet launching in **2026** and scaling to **20,000+ vehicles over six years**. This approach enables **faster go-to-market** (leveraging existing vehicle manufacturing) and **capital efficiency** (avoiding vehicle production costs). Nuro's **100+ patents** (Jiajun Zhu alone awarded 100+) and **deep expertise from Waymo alumni** provide competitive moats. The licensing model aligns with Nuro's **fourth-generation hardware system** designed for **flexible integration** across vehicle platforms with **modular sensor configurations** and **scalable compute architectures**.

### Commercial Deployment - Real-World Autonomy in Texas, Arizona, California

Nuro operates **commercial autonomous delivery services** in **Texas, Arizona, and California**, providing the **real-world testing ground** essential for developing safe autonomy. Partnerships span **grocery delivery** (Kroger since 2018, starting in Scottsdale, Arizona), **convenience stores** (7-Eleven, California's first commercial autonomous delivery service), **pharmacy** (CVS), **food delivery** (Domino's), and **logistics** (FedEx pilot in Houston). Unlike companies operating solely in simulation or controlled environments, Nuro's **fleet accumulates edge case data** from unpredictable real-world scenarios — pedestrians jaywalking, construction zones, emergency vehicles, adverse weather. This data directly trains **CIMRL's reinforcement learning** and validates **unified perception model performance** across diverse conditions. The **R3 vehicle platform** includes **pedestrian protection airbag** (front external airbag deploying on collision), demonstrating Nuro's focus on **safety in mixed traffic environments**. The company's **regulatory expertise** (first to receive NHTSA exemptions for purpose-built autonomous vehicles) accelerates deployment timelines. Commercial operations generate **revenue** while providing **training data**, creating a **data flywheel** where deployed systems improve next-generation models. The **2026 Uber robotaxi launch** expands Nuro's deployment from goods delivery to passenger transport, demonstrating platform versatility and scaling potential.
