# Neocloud War: Abilities & Strategy  

## Core Abilities  
The modern neocloud's competitive edge depends on a set of core capabilities that enable sustainable low-cost GPU compute at scale:  

- **GPU supply priority — get allocation first.** Without strong supply chain relationships and the ability to commit capital for future GPUs, a neocloud cannot scale.  
- **Fast datacenter buildout — deploy capacity quickly.** Speedy buildout of high-density AI datacenters converts GPU allocations into revenue and prevents hardware idle.  
- **Cheap, stable energy — lower operational costs.** Long-term power agreements in low-cost, stable grids (nuclear, hydro, renewable) cut operating expenses.  
- **High-density InfiniBand clusters — scale training efficiently.** Networking designed for AI workloads (InfiniBand-based clusters) ensures low-latency, high-bandwidth communication for large distributed models.  
- **Low or no legacy burden — move faster without baggage.** A clean-sheet architecture with no general-purpose cloud services or older infrastructure allows rapid adoption of new GPU generations and reduces overhead.  
- **Lean financial structure — price aggressively when needed.** Having low debt and disciplined capital expenditure enables the provider to sustain aggressive pricing while investing in expansion.  

## Secondary Abilities  
These abilities support the core capabilities but are not foundational:  

- **High cluster reliability.** Minimising hardware faults and job failures improves utilisation and customer trust.  
- **Strong ML tooling & orchestration.** Efficient schedulers, elastic clusters and developer-friendly APIs reduce friction for users.  
- **Efficient multi-tenancy.** Ensuring high GPU utilisation without performance interference across tenants increases return on assets.  
- **Regulatory and regional posture.** Compliance with data sovereignty and local regulations opens markets and aligns with sovereign-cloud demand.  
- **Procurement & CapEx discipline.** Avoid overpaying for hardware and commit to the right GPU generations at the right time.  
- **Talent concentration in infra & ML systems.** Skilled engineers optimise cluster performance and innovate on networking, scheduling and cost efficiencies.  

## Strategic Playbook for a Neocloud  
The strategic priorities describe how a neocloud should deploy its capabilities to win the GPU cloud "war":  

- **Cost leadership at scale.** Pursue the lowest cost per unit of compute by leveraging cheap energy, efficient datacenters and high utilisation. Price aggressively to undercut hyperscalers and peers.  
- **AI-native focus.** Build only the services necessary for AI workloads—training, fine-tuning, inference and model serving—avoiding general-purpose compute that adds complexity and legacy burden.  
- **Customer simplicity and performance.** Make it as easy to use 1 000 GPUs as 1 GPU: fast provisioning, predictable scheduling, stable clusters and responsive support.  
- **Scale flywheel.** Use scale to negotiate GPU supply and energy contracts: more GPUs → more revenue → more datacenters → better supply deals → more GPUs.  
- **Strategic geography.** Deploy datacenters in regions with structural advantages such as cold climates, cheap power and favourable regulation to lock in lower costs.  
- **Debt discipline.** Finance growth with cash and prudent CapEx rather than leverage. Avoid debt traps that force high pricing and slow expansion.  
- **Differentiate from hyperscalers.** Do not replicate general-purpose cloud models. Build lean, specialised infrastructure designed for AI workloads.  

Together, these abilities and strategic choices define the modern neocloud's competitive landscape and determine who will win the race to deliver the most efficient GPU compute.
