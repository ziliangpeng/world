# Model Deep Dive Documentation Guidelines

## Core Principles

1. **Lean and focused** - Each doc should cover model-specific technical details and story only
2. **No generic explanations** - Don't explain basic concepts (MoE, RoPE, GQA, attention, etc.) - those belong in architectural-patterns/
3. **Inline source links** - Link to sources where claims are made, not just in a Sources section at the end
4. **Accurate performance framing** - Use honest capability assessments:
   - "GPT-3.5 class" / "GPT-4 class" / "between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4"
   - Include benchmark numbers to justify the claim

## Structure

### Required Sections

- **Overview** - What the model is, release date, key differentiator, performance summary
  - Include model's **significance** (why it matters in the landscape)
  - Mention **technical innovations** (what's new/different about this model)
- **Model Specifications** - Table with params, architecture, context, etc.
- **Architecture** - Model-specific architectural details and choices
  - Focus on what makes THIS model's architecture unique
  - Reference architectural-patterns/ for generic concepts, don't re-explain them
- **Training** - Infrastructure, GPU count, data (if known)
- **Performance** - Benchmark table with actual numbers
- **Sources** - Official + analysis links

### Optional Sections (only if model-specific)

- Unique features (e.g., BitTorrent release, vision capabilities)
- License details (if notable, e.g., Apache vs custom)

### Sections to AVOID

- Generic architecture explanations (link to architectural-patterns/ instead)
- Inference requirements tables (generic calculation from params)
- Verbose comparison tables with competitors
- Use cases and example dialogs
- API tutorials and code samples
- TOC (table of contents)

## Formatting

- Blank line before bullet point lists
- Tables for specifications and benchmarks
- Inline links: `[text](url)` throughout, not just in Sources
- Company/infrastructure info goes in company overview file (e.g., xai-overview.md)

## File Naming

- `{company}-{model}.md` (e.g., `xai-grok-1.md`, `alibaba-qwen-2.5.md`)
- Company overview: `{company}-overview.md`

## Commit After Edits

Always commit changes with descriptive message after editing docs.
