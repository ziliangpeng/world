# TODO - Deep Dive Topics

Ideas and topics to explore in depth.

## LLM & AI

- [ ] LLM decoding behavior steering and search
  - Decoding strategies (greedy, beam search, sampling)
  - Temperature, top-k, top-p (nucleus sampling)
  - Constrained decoding and structured outputs
  - Speculative decoding
  - Guidance and control methods (classifier-free guidance, etc.)
- [ ] model behavior steering

## Hardware & Infrastructure

- [ ] GPU connectivity deep dive - write blog post about GPU interconnect technologies

## To Be Categorized

- [ ] multi-node inference connectivity technology
