#### Standard Interconnects (Primarily CPU-GPU):
- **PCIe** (PCI Express) - Universal standard, connects GPU to CPU and other PCIe devices
  - PCIe 1.0 (2003): ~4 GB/s per x16 slot
  - PCIe 2.0 (2007): ~8 GB/s per x16 slot
  - PCIe 3.0 (2010): ~16 GB/s per x16 slot
  - PCIe 4.0 (2017): ~32 GB/s per x16 slot
  - PCIe 5.0 (2019): ~64 GB/s per x16 slot
  - PCIe 6.0 (2022): ~128 GB/s per x16 slot
  - PCIe 7.0 (Spec target 2025): ~256 GB/s per x16 slot (in development)


**A Note on Aggregate vs. Per-Link Bandwidth:** A GPU uses only **one** PCIe x16 slot for CPU communication (~64 GB/s with PCIe 5.0). While this may be faster than a single proprietary link (e.g., one NVLink 4.0 link is 50 GB/s), a high-end GPU has many such links. For example, an NVIDIA H100 has **18** NVLink 4.0 links, providing a total of **900 GB/s** for GPU-to-GPU communication. It is this massive difference in *aggregate* bandwidth that makes proprietary interconnects crucial for multi-GPU performance.

### **Layer 2: Intra-Node Communication** (Within a single server)

**Note on Layers:** Layer 1 is the **connectivity hardware** (e.g., NVLink, PCIe). Layer 2 consists of the **drivers, specialized orchestration hardware (e.g., DMA engines for GPUDirect), and software libraries** that manage data transfers and collective operations across the Layer 1 hardware.

#### Public Standards:
- **CXL** (Compute Express Link) - Emerging cache-coherent interconnect (announced 2019).
  - Built on PCIe physical layer
  - Enables CPU-GPU memory coherency
  - **Performance & Adoption:**
    - **Bandwidth:** Determined by the underlying PCIe physical layer (e.g., ~64 GB/s on PCIe 5.0 x16).
    - **Latency:** While higher than local DRAM (~200-300ns vs. <100ns), it is orders of magnitude faster than NVMe storage.
    - **Outlook:** This performance trade-off is enabling large-scale memory expansion, and CXL is now seen as the essential successor to PCIe for memory-centric data center workloads.

    - Runtime loads code/data onto RDUs and manages execution
  - **Scaling:** Seamlessly scales from one to multiple RDUs using the same programming model.
  - **Abstraction:** High-level (works with standard ML frameworks) but maps to spatial dataflow execution.

- **tt-metal** (Tenstorrent)

    - **CPU Overhead:** Minimal due to hardware RDMA offload and NIC-resident DMA engines
  - **IBGDA** (InfiniBand GPU-Async) - GPU-initiated network operations
  - Connects host channel adapters (HCAs) in each server to InfiniBand switches arranged in multi-tier topologies (fat tree, dragonfly, etc.) for cluster-wide reachability

  - Provides RDMA read/write/atomic and send/receive operations with credit-based, lossless flow control and adaptive routing
  - In-network capabilities (e.g., SHARP reductions) can accelerate collectives when leveraged by libraries such as NCCL or UCX
- **RoCE** (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) - RDMA on Ethernet
  - Implements InfiniBand verbs over Ethernet (lossless via PFC/ECN), letting deployments reuse Ethernet fabrics instead of dedicated InfiniBand gear
  - Generational timeline:
    - RoCE v1 (2010): Layer 2 RDMA over 10/40 GbE fabrics for single subnet deployments
    - RoCE v2 (2014): Adds UDP/IP encapsulation for Layer 3 routing; scales with 40/56/100 GbE links
    - RoCE v2 + 25/50/100 GbE (2016): Aligns with IEEE 802.3by/bs, enabling 25/50/100 GbE low-latency clusters
    - RoCE v2 + 200/400 GbE (2019): Widely deployed in cloud/HPC fabrics as 200/400 GbE switches and NICs ship

    - **Latency:** 2-6 Î¼s end-to-end (port-to-port switch latency ~230 ns; as low as 1.3 Î¼s with high-end NICs)
    - **CPU Overhead:** Low due to hardware RDMA offload (comparable to InfiniBand)
    - **Configuration Complexity:** Requires proper tuning of PFC (Priority Flow Control) and ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) for lossless operation
- **Ethernet** - Standard networking (100GbE, 200GbE, 400GbE)

    - 50/200 GbE (2018): IEEE 802.3cd/bs; PAM4 signaling doubles throughput per lane
    - 400 GbE (2019): IEEE 802.3bs; baseline for modern AI/HPC spine networks
    - 800 GbE (2022): IEEE 802.3ck/df; early hyperscaler backbone deployments
  - Common deployments today: 100 GbE, 200 GbE, 400 GbE, with early 800 GbE adoption
  - **Performance Limitations (TCP/IP):**
    - **High Latency:** Standard TCP/IP stack incurs 50+ Î¼s latency (vs 1-6 Î¼s for RDMA technologies like InfiniBand/RoCE)
    - **High CPU Overhead:** Kernel must process every packet, copy data through system memory, and manage protocol stack
    - **Not Suitable for GPU-GPU Communication:** Without RDMA (RoCE), standard Ethernet is impractical for AI training workloads due to 10-50x higher latency

**Network Fabric Performance Summary:**

| Technology | Latency | Bandwidth (Current) | CPU Overhead | Cost | Complexity | Use Case |
|------------|---------|---------------------|--------------|------|------------|----------|
| **InfiniBand** | 1-2 Î¼s (best) | 200-800 Gbps | Minimal | Highest | High (dedicated fabric) | HPC, large-scale AI training |
| **RoCE** | 2-6 Î¼s | 100-800 GbE | Low | Medium | Medium (PFC/ECN tuning) | AI training, cloud datacenter |
| **Ethernet (TCP/IP)** | 50+ Î¼s | 100-800 GbE | High | Lowest | Low | General networking, not AI training |

**Key Insights:**
- **Bandwidth scales dramatically across generations** (10 Gb/s â†’ 800 Gb/s over 20 years), but **latency improvements are minimal** due to physics constraints (speed of light) and error correction overhead
- **Technology choice matters more than generation** for latency: InfiniBand vs RoCE vs TCP/IP represents a 25-50x difference, while generational improvements within each technology are only ~3x over 20 years
- **InfiniBand**: Gold standard for lowest latency and predictable performance; requires dedicated hardware and separate network fabric
- **RoCE**: Has narrowed the gap to 95-98% of InfiniBand performance while offering significant cost savings (55% TCO reduction) and infrastructure flexibility
- **TCP/IP**: Not viable for GPU-to-GPU communication in AI workloads without RDMA acceleration
- **Real-world benchmarks**: NCCL tests show InfiniBand and RoCE achieve nearly identical throughput (~195 GBps on 16 GPUs), with latency differences staying within nanoseconds for properly configured RoCE deployments
- **Adoption**: InfiniBand leads in TOP500 supercomputers (47.8%), but RoCE leads in total port bandwidth deployed (48.5%), reflecting its cost-effectiveness for large-scale deployments
