#### Standard Interconnects (Primarily CPU-GPU):
- **PCIe** (PCI Express) - Universal standard, connects GPU to CPU and other PCIe devices
  - PCIe 1.0 (2003): ~4 GB/s per x16 slot
  - PCIe 2.0 (2007): ~8 GB/s per x16 slot
  - PCIe 3.0 (2010): ~16 GB/s per x16 slot
  - PCIe 4.0 (2017): ~32 GB/s per x16 slot
  - PCIe 5.0 (2019): ~64 GB/s per x16 slot
  - PCIe 6.0 (2022): ~128 GB/s per x16 slot
  - PCIe 7.0 (Spec target 2025): ~256 GB/s per x16 slot (in development)


**A Note on Aggregate vs. Per-Link Bandwidth:** A GPU uses only **one** PCIe x16 slot for CPU communication (~64 GB/s with PCIe 5.0). While this may be faster than a single proprietary link (e.g., one NVLink 4.0 link is 50 GB/s), a high-end GPU has many such links. For example, an NVIDIA H100 has **18** NVLink 4.0 links, providing a total of **900 GB/s** for GPU-to-GPU communication. It is this massive difference in *aggregate* bandwidth that makes proprietary interconnects crucial for multi-GPU performance.

### **Layer 2: Intra-Node Communication** (Within a single server)

**Note on Layers:** Layer 1 is the **connectivity hardware** (e.g., NVLink, PCIe). Layer 2 consists of the **drivers, specialized orchestration hardware (e.g., DMA engines for GPUDirect), and software libraries** that manage data transfers and collective operations across the Layer 1 hardware.

#### Public Standards:
- **CXL** (Compute Express Link) - Emerging cache-coherent interconnect (announced 2019).
  - Built on PCIe physical layer
  - Enables CPU-GPU memory coherency
  - **Performance & Adoption:**
    - **Bandwidth:** Determined by the underlying PCIe physical layer (e.g., ~64 GB/s on PCIe 5.0 x16).
    - **Latency:** While higher than local DRAM (~200-300ns vs. <100ns), it is orders of magnitude faster than NVMe storage.
    - **Outlook:** This performance trade-off is enabling large-scale memory expansion, and CXL is now seen as the essential successor to PCIe for memory-centric data center workloads.
