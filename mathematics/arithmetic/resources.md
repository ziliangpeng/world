## Notes

**"Elementary" doesn't mean "easy"!**

In mathematics, "elementary number theory" means using only basic tools (not requiring complex analysis or abstract algebra). It doesn't mean the content is simple or trivial - elementary number theory contains deep, beautiful results and is typically taught at the college level.
