### Summary of Go 1.18

Go 1.18 was a historic release, introducing **Generics** to the language. It also added built-in **Fuzzing** support and a new **Workspaces** mode.

**Language Features & Syntax**
*   The headline feature is the implementation of **Generics**, allowing for type parameters in functions and types. This includes parameterized function calls (e.g., `max[int](a, b)`), interface type constraints, and the new `any` and `comparable` predeclared identifiers.

**Performance Improvements**
*   The **register-based calling convention** was expanded to 64-bit ARM and PowerPC architectures, bringing performance improvements of 10% or more to those platforms.
*   The compiler can now inline functions containing `range` loops.
*   *Build performance regressed*, with compile times being roughly 15% slower than Go 1.17 due to the complexity of adding generics.

**Tooling & Developer Experience**
*   **Fuzzing:** Built-in support for fuzz testing is now part of the standard toolchain, accessible via `go test -fuzz`.
*   **Workspaces:** The new `go work` command and `go.work` files allow developers to easily work across multiple modules simultaneously.
*   `go get` is now only for managing dependencies; `go install` must be used to install commands.
*   The `go` command now embeds version control and build information into binaries.

**Major Library Updates**
*   A new `net/netip` package was introduced, providing a new, more efficient, and comparable IP address type (`netip.Addr`).
*   As previously announced, client-side **TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are now disabled by default**.
*   As previously announced, the `crypto/x509` package now **rejects certificates signed with SHA-1**.
*   A new `debug/buildinfo` package provides access to the build information embedded in binaries.
