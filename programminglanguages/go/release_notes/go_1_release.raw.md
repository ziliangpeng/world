## Introduction to Go 1 {#introduction}

Go version 1, Go 1 for short, defines a language and a set of core
libraries that provide a stable foundation for creating reliable
products, projects, and publications.

The driving motivation for Go 1 is stability for its users. People
should be able to write Go programs and expect that they will continue
to compile and run without change, on a time scale of years, including
in production environments such as Google App Engine. Similarly, people
should be able to write books about Go, be able to say which version of
Go the book is describing, and have that version number still be
meaningful much later.

Code that compiles in Go 1 should, with few exceptions, continue to
compile and run throughout the lifetime of that version, even as we
issue updates and bug fixes such as Go version 1.1, 1.2, and so on.
Other than critical fixes, changes made to the language and library for
subsequent releases of Go 1 may add functionality but will not break
existing Go 1 programs. [The Go 1 compatibility
document](go1compat.html) explains the compatibility guidelines in more
detail.

Go 1 is a representation of Go as it used today, not a wholesale
rethinking of the language. We avoided designing new features and
instead focused on cleaning up problems and inconsistencies and
improving portability. There are a number changes to the Go language and
packages that we had considered for some time and prototyped but not
released primarily because they are significant and
backwards-incompatible. Go 1 was an opportunity to get them out, which
is helpful for the long term, but also means that Go 1 introduces
incompatibilities for old programs. Fortunately, the `go` `fix` tool can
automate much of the work needed to bring programs up to the Go 1
standard.

This document outlines the major changes in Go 1 that will affect
programmers updating existing code; its reference point is the prior
release, r60 (tagged as r60.3). It also explains how to update code from
r60 to run under Go 1.

## Changes to the language {#language}

### Append

The `append` predeclared variadic function makes it easy to grow a slice
by adding elements to the end. A common use is to add bytes to the end
of a byte slice when generating output. However, `append` did not
provide a way to append a string to a `[]byte`, which is another common
case.

::: code
        greeting := []byte{}
        greeting = append(greeting, []byte("hello ")...)
:::

By analogy with the similar property of `copy`, Go 1 permits a string to
be appended (byte-wise) directly to a byte slice, reducing the friction
between strings and byte slices. The conversion is no longer necessary:

::: code
        greeting = append(greeting, "world"...)
:::

*Updating*: This is a new feature, so existing code needs no changes.

### Close

The `close` predeclared function provides a mechanism for a sender to
signal that no more values will be sent. It is important to the
implementation of `for` `range` loops over channels and is helpful in
other situations. Partly by design and partly because of race conditions
that can occur otherwise, it is intended for use only by the goroutine
sending on the channel, not by the goroutine receiving data. However,
before Go 1 there was no compile-time checking that `close` was being
used correctly.

To close this gap, at least in part, Go 1 disallows `close` on
receive-only channels. Attempting to close such a channel is a
compile-time error.

::: code
        var c chan int
        var csend chan<- int = c
        var crecv <-chan int = c
        close(c)     // legal
        close(csend) // legal
        close(crecv) // illegal
:::

*Updating*: Existing code that attempts to close a receive-only channel
was erroneous even before Go 1 and should be fixed. The compiler will
now reject such code.

### Composite literals {#literals}

In Go 1, a composite literal of array, slice, or map type can elide the
type specification for the elements' initializers if they are of pointer
type. All four of the initializations in this example are legal; the
last one was illegal before Go 1.

::: code
        type Date struct {
            month string
            day   int
        }
        // Struct values, fully qualified; always legal.
        holiday1 := []Date{
            Date{"Feb", 14},
            Date{"Nov", 11},
            Date{"Dec", 25},
        }
        // Struct values, type name elided; always legal.
        holiday2 := []Date{
            {"Feb", 14},
            {"Nov", 11},
            {"Dec", 25},
        }
        // Pointers, fully qualified, always legal.
        holiday3 := []*Date{
            &Date{"Feb", 14},
            &Date{"Nov", 11},
            &Date{"Dec", 25},
        }
        // Pointers, type name elided; legal in Go 1.
        holiday4 := []*Date{
            {"Feb", 14},
            {"Nov", 11},
            {"Dec", 25},
        }
:::

*Updating*: This change has no effect on existing code, but the command
`gofmt` `-s` applied to existing source will, among other things, elide
explicit element types wherever permitted.

### Goroutines during init {#init}

The old language defined that `go` statements executed during
initialization created goroutines but that they did not begin to run
until initialization of the entire program was complete. This introduced
clumsiness in many places and, in effect, limited the utility of the
`init` construct: if it was possible for another package to use the
library during initialization, the library was forced to avoid
goroutines. This design was done for reasons of simplicity and safety
but, as our confidence in the language grew, it seemed unnecessary.
Running goroutines during initialization is no more complex or unsafe
than running them during normal execution.

In Go 1, code that uses goroutines can be called from `init` routines
and global initialization expressions without introducing a deadlock.

::: code
    var PackageGlobal int

    func init() {
        c := make(chan int)
        go initializationFunction(c)
        PackageGlobal = <-c
    }
:::

*Updating*: This is a new feature, so existing code needs no changes,
although it's possible that code that depends on goroutines not starting
before `main` will break. There was no such code in the standard
repository.

### The rune type {#rune}

The language spec allows the `int` type to be 32 or 64 bits wide, but
current implementations set `int` to 32 bits even on 64-bit platforms.
It would be preferable to have `int` be 64 bits on 64-bit platforms.
(There are important consequences for indexing large slices.) However,
this change would waste space when processing Unicode characters with
the old language because the `int` type was also used to hold Unicode
code points: each code point would waste an extra 32 bits of storage if
`int` grew from 32 bits to 64.

To make changing to 64-bit `int` feasible, Go 1 introduces a new basic
type, `rune`, to represent individual Unicode code points. It is an
alias for `int32`, analogous to `byte` as an alias for `uint8`.

Character literals such as `'a'`, `'語'`, and `'\u0345'` now have
default type `rune`, analogous to `1.0` having default type `float64`. A
variable initialized to a character constant will therefore have type
`rune` unless otherwise specified.

Libraries have been updated to use `rune` rather than `int` when
appropriate. For instance, the functions `unicode.ToLower` and relatives
now take and return a `rune`.

::: code
        delta := 'δ' // delta has type rune.
        var DELTA rune
        DELTA = unicode.ToUpper(delta)
        epsilon := unicode.ToLower(DELTA + 1)
        if epsilon != 'δ'+1 {
            log.Fatal("inconsistent casing for Greek")
        }
:::

*Updating*: Most source code will be unaffected by this because the type
inference from `:=` initializers introduces the new type silently, and
it propagates from there. Some code may get type errors that a trivial
conversion will resolve.

### The error type {#error}

Go 1 introduces a new built-in type, `error`, which has the following
definition:

        type error interface {
            Error() string
        }

Since the consequences of this type are all in the package library, it
is discussed [below](#errors).

### Deleting from maps {#delete}

In the old language, to delete the entry with key `k` from map `m`, one
wrote the statement,

        m[k] = value, false

This syntax was a peculiar special case, the only two-to-one assignment.
It required passing a value (usually ignored) that is evaluated but
discarded, plus a boolean that was nearly always the constant `false`.
It did the job but was odd and a point of contention.

In Go 1, that syntax has gone; instead there is a new built-in function,
`delete`. The call

::: code
        delete(m, k)
:::

will delete the map entry retrieved by the expression `m[k]`. There is
no return value. Deleting a non-existent entry is a no-op.

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will convert expressions of the form
`m[k] = value, false` into `delete(m, k)` when it is clear that the
ignored value can be safely discarded from the program and `false`
refers to the predefined boolean constant. The fix tool will flag other
uses of the syntax for inspection by the programmer.

### Iterating in maps {#iteration}

The old language specification did not define the order of iteration for
maps, and in practice it differed across hardware platforms. This caused
tests that iterated over maps to be fragile and non-portable, with the
unpleasant property that a test might always pass on one machine but
break on another.

In Go 1, the order in which elements are visited when iterating over a
map using a `for` `range` statement is defined to be unpredictable, even
if the same loop is run multiple times with the same map. Code should
not assume that the elements are visited in any particular order.

This change means that code that depends on iteration order is very
likely to break early and be fixed long before it becomes a problem.
Just as important, it allows the map implementation to ensure better map
balancing even when programs are using range loops to select an element
from a mapl.

::: code
        m := map[string]int{"Sunday": 0, "Monday": 1}
        for name, value := range m {
            // This loop should not assume Sunday will be visited first.
            f(name, value)
        }
:::

*Updating*: This is one change where tools cannot help. Most existing
code will be unaffected, but some programs may break or misbehave; we
recommend manual checking of all range statements over maps to verify
they do not depend on iteration order. There were a few such examples in
the standard repository; they have been fixed. Note that it was already
incorrect to depend on the iteration order, which was unspecified. This
change codifies the unpredictability.

### Multiple assignment {#multiple_assignment}

The language specification has long guaranteed that in assignments the
right-hand-side expressions are all evaluated before any left-hand-side
expressions are assigned. To guarantee predictable behavior, Go 1
refines the specification further.

If the left-hand side of the assignment statement contains expressions
that require evaluation, such as function calls or array indexing
operations, these will all be done using the usual left-to-right rule
before any variables are assigned their value. Once everything is
evaluated, the actual assignments proceed in left-to-right order.

These examples illustrate the behavior.

::: code
        sa := []int{1, 2, 3}
        i := 0
        i, sa[i] = 1, 2 // sets i = 1, sa[0] = 2

        sb := []int{1, 2, 3}
        j := 0
        sb[j], j = 2, 1 // sets sb[0] = 2, j = 1

        sc := []int{1, 2, 3}
        sc[0], sc[0] = 1, 2 // sets sc[0] = 1, then sc[0] = 2 (so sc[0] = 2 at end)
:::

*Updating*: This is one change where tools cannot help, but breakage is
unlikely. No code in the standard repository was broken by this change,
and code that depended on the previous unspecified behavior was already
incorrect.

### Returns and shadowed variables {#shadowing}

A common mistake is to use `return` (without arguments) after an
assignment to a variable that has the same name as a result variable but
is not the same variable. This situation is called *shadowing*: the
result variable has been shadowed by another variable with the same name
declared in an inner scope.

In functions with named return values, the Go 1 compilers disallow
return statements without arguments if any of the named return values is
shadowed at the point of the return statement. (It isn't part of the
specification, because this is one area we are still exploring; the
situation is analogous to the compilers rejecting functions that do not
end with an explicit return statement.)

This function implicitly returns a shadowed return value and will be
rejected by the compiler:

::: code
    func Bug() (i, j, k int) {
        for i = 0; i < 5; i++ {
            for j := 0; j < 5; j++ { // Redeclares j.
                k += i * j
                if k > 100 {
                    return // Rejected: j is shadowed here.
                }
            }
        }
        return // OK: j is not shadowed here.
    }
:::

*Updating*: Code that shadows return values in this way will be rejected
by the compiler and will need to be fixed by hand. The few cases that
arose in the standard repository were mostly bugs.

### Copying structs with unexported fields {#unexported}

The old language did not allow a package to make a copy of a struct
value containing unexported fields belonging to a different package.
There was, however, a required exception for a method receiver; also,
the implementations of `copy` and `append` have never honored the
restriction.

Go 1 will allow packages to copy struct values containing unexported
fields from other packages. Besides resolving the inconsistency, this
change admits a new kind of API: a package can return an opaque value
without resorting to a pointer or interface. The new implementations of
`time.Time` and `reflect.Value` are examples of types taking advantage
of this new property.

As an example, if package `p` includes the definitions,

        type Struct struct {
            Public int
            secret int
        }
        func NewStruct(a int) Struct {  // Note: not a pointer.
            return Struct{a, f(a)}
        }
        func (s Struct) String() string {
            return fmt.Sprintf("{%d (secret %d)}", s.Public, s.secret)
        }

a package that imports `p` can assign and copy values of type `p.Struct`
at will. Behind the scenes the unexported fields will be assigned and
copied just as if they were exported, but the client code will never be
aware of them. The code

        import "p"

        myStruct := p.NewStruct(23)
        copyOfMyStruct := myStruct
        fmt.Println(myStruct, copyOfMyStruct)

will show that the secret field of the struct has been copied to the new
value.

*Updating*: This is a new feature, so existing code needs no changes.

### Equality

Before Go 1, the language did not define equality on struct and array
values. This meant, among other things, that structs and arrays could
not be used as map keys. On the other hand, Go did define equality on
function and map values. Function equality was problematic in the
presence of closures (when are two closures equal?) while map equality
compared pointers, not the maps' content, which was usually not what the
user would want.

Go 1 addressed these issues. First, structs and arrays can be compared
for equality and inequality (`==` and `!=`), and therefore be used as
map keys, provided they are composed from elements for which equality is
also defined, using element-wise comparison.

::: code
        type Day struct {
            long  string
            short string
        }
        Christmas := Day{"Christmas", "XMas"}
        Thanksgiving := Day{"Thanksgiving", "Turkey"}
        holiday := map[Day]bool{
            Christmas:    true,
            Thanksgiving: true,
        }
        fmt.Printf("Christmas is a holiday: %t\n", holiday[Christmas])
:::

Second, Go 1 removes the definition of equality for function values,
except for comparison with `nil`. Finally, map equality is gone too,
also except for comparison with `nil`.

Note that equality is still undefined for slices, for which the
calculation is in general infeasible. Also note that the ordered
comparison operators (\< \<= `>` `>=`) are still undefined for structs
and arrays.

*Updating*: Struct and array equality is a new feature, so existing code
needs no changes. Existing code that depends on function or map equality
will be rejected by the compiler and will need to be fixed by hand. Few
programs will be affected, but the fix may require some redesign.

## The package hierarchy {#packages}

Go 1 addresses many deficiencies in the old standard library and cleans
up a number of packages, making them more internally consistent and
portable.

This section describes how the packages have been rearranged in Go 1.
Some have moved, some have been renamed, some have been deleted. New
packages are described in later sections.

### The package hierarchy {#hierarchy}

Go 1 has a rearranged package hierarchy that groups related items into
subdirectories. For instance, `utf8` and `utf16` now occupy
subdirectories of `unicode`. Also, [some packages](#subrepo) have moved
into subrepositories of
[`code.google.com/p/go`](https://code.google.com/p/go){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} while [others](#deleted) have been deleted outright.

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

Note that the package names for the old `cmath` and `exp/template/html`
packages have changed to `cmplx` and `template`.

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will update all imports and package
renames for packages that remain inside the standard repository.
Programs that import packages that are no longer in the standard
repository will need to be edited by hand.

### The package tree exp {#exp}

Because they are not standardized, the packages under the `exp`
directory will not be available in the standard Go 1 release
distributions, although they will be available in source code form in
[the repository](https://code.google.com/p/go/){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} for developers who wish to use them.

Several packages have moved under `exp` at the time of Go 1's release:

- `ebnf`
- `html`^†^
- `go/types`

(^†^The `EscapeString` and `UnescapeString` types remain in package
`html`.)

All these packages are available under the same names, with the prefix
`exp/`: `exp/ebnf` etc.

Also, the `utf8.String` type has been moved to its own package,
`exp/utf8string`.

Finally, the `gotype` command now resides in `exp/gotype`, while
`ebnflint` is now in `exp/ebnflint`. If they are installed, they now
reside in `$GOROOT/bin/tool`.

*Updating*: Code that uses packages in `exp` will need to be updated by
hand, or else compiled from an installation that has `exp` available.
The `go` `fix` tool or the compiler will complain about such uses.

### The package tree old {#old}

Because they are deprecated, the packages under the `old` directory will
not be available in the standard Go 1 release distributions, although
they will be available in source code form for developers who wish to
use them.

The packages in their new locations are:

- `old/netchan`

*Updating*: Code that uses packages now in `old` will need to be updated
by hand, or else compiled from an installation that has `old` available.
The `go` `fix` tool will warn about such uses.

### Deleted packages {#deleted}

Go 1 deletes several packages outright:

- `container/vector`
- `exp/datafmt`
- `go/typechecker`
- `old/regexp`
- `old/template`
- `try`

and also the command `gotry`.

*Updating*: Code that uses `container/vector` should be updated to use
slices directly. See [the Go Language Community
Wiki](https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/SliceTricks){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} for some suggestions. Code that uses the other packages
(there should be almost zero) will need to be rethought.

### Packages moving to subrepositories {#subrepo}

Go 1 has moved a number of packages into other repositories, usually
sub-repositories of [the main Go
repository](https://code.google.com/p/go/){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"}. This table lists the old and new import paths:

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will update imports of these packages to
use the new import paths. Installations that depend on these packages
will need to install them using a `go get` command.

## Major changes to the library {#major}

This section describes significant changes to the core libraries, the
ones that affect the most programs.

### The error type and errors package {#errors}

The placement of `os.Error` in package `os` is mostly historical: errors
first came up when implementing package `os`, and they seemed
system-related at the time. Since then it has become clear that errors
are more fundamental than the operating system. For example, it would be
nice to use `Errors` in packages that `os` depends on, like `syscall`.
Also, having `Error` in `os` introduces many dependencies on `os` that
would otherwise not exist.

Go 1 solves these problems by introducing a built-in `error` interface
type and a separate `errors` package (analogous to `bytes` and
`strings`) that contains utility functions. It replaces `os.NewError`
with [`errors.New`](/pkg/errors/#New), giving errors a more central
place in the environment.

So the widely-used `String` method does not cause accidental
satisfaction of the `error` interface, the `error` interface uses
instead the name `Error` for that method:

        type error interface {
            Error() string
        }

The `fmt` library automatically invokes `Error`, as it already does for
`String`, for easy printing of error values.

::: code
    type SyntaxError struct {
        File    string
        Line    int
        Message string
    }

    func (se *SyntaxError) Error() string {
        return fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d: %s", se.File, se.Line, se.Message)
    }
:::

All standard packages have been updated to use the new interface; the
old `os.Error` is gone.

A new package, [`errors`](/pkg/errors/), contains the function

    func New(text string) error

to turn a string into an error. It replaces the old `os.NewError`.

::: code
        var ErrSyntax = errors.New("syntax error")
:::

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will update almost all code affected by
the change. Code that defines error types with a `String` method will
need to be updated by hand to rename the methods to `Error`.

### System call errors {#errno}

The old `syscall` package, which predated `os.Error` (and just about
everything else), returned errors as `int` values. In turn, the `os`
package forwarded many of these errors, such as `EINVAL`, but using a
different set of errors on each platform. This behavior was unpleasant
and unportable.

In Go 1, the [`syscall`](/pkg/syscall/) package instead returns an
`error` for system call errors. On Unix, the implementation is done by a
[`syscall.Errno`](/pkg/syscall/#Errno) type that satisfies `error` and
replaces the old `os.Errno`.

The changes affecting `os.EINVAL` and relatives are described
[elsewhere](#os).

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will update almost all code affected by
the change. Regardless, most code should use the `os` package rather
than `syscall` and so will be unaffected.

### Time

Time is always a challenge to support well in a programming language.
The old Go `time` package had `int64` units, no real type safety, and no
distinction between absolute times and durations.

One of the most sweeping changes in the Go 1 library is therefore a
complete redesign of the [`time`](/pkg/time/) package. Instead of an
integer number of nanoseconds as an `int64`, and a separate `*time.Time`
type to deal with human units such as hours and years, there are now two
fundamental types: [`time.Time`](/pkg/time/#Time) (a value, so the `*`
is gone), which represents a moment in time; and
[`time.Duration`](/pkg/time/#Duration), which represents an interval.
Both have nanosecond resolution. A `Time` can represent any time into
the ancient past and remote future, while a `Duration` can span plus or
minus only about 290 years. There are methods on these types, plus a
number of helpful predefined constant durations such as `time.Second`.

Among the new methods are things like [`Time.Add`](/pkg/time/#Time.Add),
which adds a `Duration` to a `Time`, and
[`Time.Sub`](/pkg/time/#Time.Sub), which subtracts two `Times` to yield
a `Duration`.

The most important semantic change is that the Unix epoch (Jan 1, 1970)
is now relevant only for those functions and methods that mention Unix:
[`time.Unix`](/pkg/time/#Unix) and the [`Unix`](/pkg/time/#Time.Unix)
and [`UnixNano`](/pkg/time/#Time.UnixNano) methods of the `Time` type.
In particular, [`time.Now`](/pkg/time/#Now) returns a `time.Time` value
rather than, in the old API, an integer nanosecond count since the Unix
epoch.

::: code
    // sleepUntil sleeps until the specified time. It returns immediately if it's too late.
    func sleepUntil(wakeup time.Time) {
        now := time.Now() // A Time.
        if !wakeup.After(now) {
            return
        }
        delta := wakeup.Sub(now) // A Duration.
        fmt.Printf("Sleeping for %.3fs\n", delta.Seconds())
        time.Sleep(delta)
    }
:::

The new types, methods, and constants have been propagated through all
the standard packages that use time, such as `os` and its representation
of file time stamps.

*Updating*: The `go` `fix` tool will update many uses of the old `time`
package to use the new types and methods, although it does not replace
values such as `1e9` representing nanoseconds per second. Also, because
of type changes in some of the values that arise, some of the
expressions rewritten by the fix tool may require further hand editing;
in such cases the rewrite will include the correct function or method
for the old functionality, but may have the wrong type or require
further analysis.

## Minor changes to the library {#minor}

This section describes smaller changes, such as those to less commonly
used packages or that affect few programs beyond the need to run `go`
`fix`. This category includes packages that are new in Go 1.
Collectively they improve portability, regularize behavior, and make the
interfaces more modern and Go-like.

### The archive/zip package {#archive_zip}

In Go 1, [`*zip.Writer`](/pkg/archive/zip/#Writer) no longer has a
`Write` method. Its presence was a mistake.

*Updating*: What little code is affected will be caught by the compiler
and must be updated by hand.

### The bufio package {#bufio}

In Go 1, [`bufio.NewReaderSize`](/pkg/bufio/#NewReaderSize) and
[`bufio.NewWriterSize`](/pkg/bufio/#NewWriterSize) functions no longer
return an error for invalid sizes. If the argument size is too small or
invalid, it is adjusted.

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will update calls that assign the error
to \_. Calls that aren't fixed will be caught by the compiler and must
be updated by hand.

### The compress/flate, compress/gzip and compress/zlib packages {#compress}

In Go 1, the `NewWriterXxx` functions in
[`compress/flate`](/pkg/compress/flate),
[`compress/gzip`](/pkg/compress/gzip) and
[`compress/zlib`](/pkg/compress/zlib) all return `(*Writer, error)` if
they take a compression level, and `*Writer` otherwise. Package `gzip`'s
`Compressor` and `Decompressor` types have been renamed to `Writer` and
`Reader`. Package `flate`'s `WrongValueError` type has been removed.

*Updating* Running `go` `fix` will update old names and calls that
assign the error to \_. Calls that aren't fixed will be caught by the
compiler and must be updated by hand.

### The crypto/aes and crypto/des packages {#crypto_aes_des}

In Go 1, the `Reset` method has been removed. Go does not guarantee that
memory is not copied and therefore this method was misleading.

The cipher-specific types `*aes.Cipher`, `*des.Cipher`, and
`*des.TripleDESCipher` have been removed in favor of `cipher.Block`.

*Updating*: Remove the calls to Reset. Replace uses of the specific
cipher types with cipher.Block.

### The crypto/elliptic package {#crypto_elliptic}

In Go 1, [`elliptic.Curve`](/pkg/crypto/elliptic/#Curve) has been made
an interface to permit alternative implementations. The curve parameters
have been moved to the
[`elliptic.CurveParams`](/pkg/crypto/elliptic/#CurveParams) structure.

*Updating*: Existing users of `*elliptic.Curve` will need to change to
simply `elliptic.Curve`. Calls to `Marshal`, `Unmarshal` and
`GenerateKey` are now functions in `crypto/elliptic` that take an
`elliptic.Curve` as their first argument.

### The crypto/hmac package {#crypto_hmac}

In Go 1, the hash-specific functions, such as `hmac.NewMD5`, have been
removed from `crypto/hmac`. Instead, `hmac.New` takes a function that
returns a `hash.Hash`, such as `md5.New`.

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will perform the needed changes.

### The crypto/x509 package {#crypto_x509}

In Go 1, the [`CreateCertificate`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#CreateCertificate)
function and [`CreateCRL`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#Certificate.CreateCRL)
method in `crypto/x509` have been altered to take an `interface{}` where
they previously took a `*rsa.PublicKey` or `*rsa.PrivateKey`. This will
allow other public key algorithms to be implemented in the future.

*Updating*: No changes will be needed.

### The encoding/binary package {#encoding_binary}

In Go 1, the `binary.TotalSize` function has been replaced by
[`Size`](/pkg/encoding/binary/#Size), which takes an `interface{}`
argument rather than a `reflect.Value`.

*Updating*: What little code is affected will be caught by the compiler
and must be updated by hand.

### The encoding/xml package {#encoding_xml}

In Go 1, the [`xml`](/pkg/encoding/xml/) package has been brought closer
in design to the other marshaling packages such as
[`encoding/gob`](/pkg/encoding/gob/).

The old `Parser` type is renamed [`Decoder`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Decoder)
and has a new [`Decode`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Decoder.Decode) method. An
[`Encoder`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Encoder) type was also introduced.

The functions [`Marshal`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Marshal) and
[`Unmarshal`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Unmarshal) work with `[]byte` values
now. To work with streams, use the new
[`Encoder`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Encoder) and
[`Decoder`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Decoder) types.

When marshaling or unmarshaling values, the format of supported flags in
field tags has changed to be closer to the [`json`](/pkg/encoding/json)
package (`` `xml:"name,flag"` ``). The matching done between field tags,
field names, and the XML attribute and element names is now
case-sensitive. The `XMLName` field tag, if present, must also match the
name of the XML element being marshaled.

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will update most uses of the package
except for some calls to `Unmarshal`. Special care must be taken with
field tags, since the fix tool will not update them and if not fixed by
hand they will misbehave silently in some cases. For example, the old
`"attr"` is now written `",attr"` while plain `"attr"` remains valid but
with a different meaning.

### The expvar package {#expvar}

In Go 1, the `RemoveAll` function has been removed. The `Iter` function
and Iter method on `*Map` have been replaced by [`Do`](/pkg/expvar/#Do)
and [`(*Map).Do`](/pkg/expvar/#Map.Do).

*Updating*: Most code using `expvar` will not need changing. The rare
code that used `Iter` can be updated to pass a closure to `Do` to
achieve the same effect.

### The flag package {#flag}

In Go 1, the interface [`flag.Value`](/pkg/flag/#Value) has changed
slightly. The `Set` method now returns an `error` instead of a `bool` to
indicate success or failure.

There is also a new kind of flag, `Duration`, to support argument values
specifying time intervals. Values for such flags must be given units,
just as `time.Duration` formats them: `10s`, `1h30m`, etc.

::: code
    var timeout = flag.Duration("timeout", 30*time.Second, "how long to wait for completion")
:::

*Updating*: Programs that implement their own flags will need minor
manual fixes to update their `Set` methods. The `Duration` flag is new
and affects no existing code.

### The go/\* packages {#go}

Several packages under `go` have slightly revised APIs.

A concrete `Mode` type was introduced for configuration mode flags in
the packages [`go/scanner`](/pkg/go/scanner/),
[`go/parser`](/pkg/go/parser/), [`go/printer`](/pkg/go/printer/), and
[`go/doc`](/pkg/go/doc/).

The modes `AllowIllegalChars` and `InsertSemis` have been removed from
the [`go/scanner`](/pkg/go/scanner/) package. They were mostly useful
for scanning text other then Go source files. Instead, the
[`text/scanner`](/pkg/text/scanner/) package should be used for that
purpose.

The [`ErrorHandler`](/pkg/go/scanner/#ErrorHandler) provided to the
scanner's [`Init`](/pkg/go/scanner/#Scanner.Init) method is now simply a
function rather than an interface. The `ErrorVector` type has been
removed in favor of the (existing)
[`ErrorList`](/pkg/go/scanner/#ErrorList) type, and the `ErrorVector`
methods have been migrated. Instead of embedding an `ErrorVector` in a
client of the scanner, now a client should maintain an `ErrorList`.

The set of parse functions provided by the
[`go/parser`](/pkg/go/parser/) package has been reduced to the primary
parse function [`ParseFile`](/pkg/go/parser/#ParseFile), and a couple of
convenience functions [`ParseDir`](/pkg/go/parser/#ParseDir) and
[`ParseExpr`](/pkg/go/parser/#ParseExpr).

The [`go/printer`](/pkg/go/printer/) package supports an additional
configuration mode [`SourcePos`](/pkg/go/printer/#Mode); if set, the
printer will emit `//line` comments such that the generated output
contains the original source code position information. The new type
[`CommentedNode`](/pkg/go/printer/#CommentedNode) can be used to provide
comments associated with an arbitrary [`ast.Node`](/pkg/go/ast/#Node)
(until now only [`ast.File`](/pkg/go/ast/#File) carried comment
information).

The type names of the [`go/doc`](/pkg/go/doc/) package have been
streamlined by removing the `Doc` suffix: `PackageDoc` is now `Package`,
`ValueDoc` is `Value`, etc. Also, all types now consistently have a
`Name` field (or `Names`, in the case of type `Value`) and
`Type.Factories` has become `Type.Funcs`. Instead of calling
`doc.NewPackageDoc(pkg, importpath)`, documentation for a package is
created with:

        doc.New(pkg, importpath, mode)

where the new `mode` parameter specifies the operation mode: if set to
[`AllDecls`](/pkg/go/doc/#AllDecls), all declarations (not just exported
ones) are considered. The function `NewFileDoc` was removed, and the
function `CommentText` has become the method
[`Text`](/pkg/go/ast/#CommentGroup.Text) of
[`ast.CommentGroup`](/pkg/go/ast/#CommentGroup).

In package [`go/token`](/pkg/go/token/), the
[`token.FileSet`](/pkg/go/token/#FileSet) method `Files` (which
originally returned a channel of `*token.File`s) has been replaced with
the iterator [`Iterate`](/pkg/go/token/#FileSet.Iterate) that accepts a
function argument instead.

In package [`go/build`](/pkg/go/build/), the API has been nearly
completely replaced. The package still computes Go package information
but it does not run the build: the `Cmd` and `Script` types are gone.
(To build code, use the new [`go`](/cmd/go/) command instead.) The
`DirInfo` type is now named [`Package`](/pkg/go/build/#Package).
`FindTree` and `ScanDir` are replaced by
[`Import`](/pkg/go/build/#Import) and
[`ImportDir`](/pkg/go/build/#ImportDir).

*Updating*: Code that uses packages in `go` will have to be updated by
hand; the compiler will reject incorrect uses. Templates used in
conjunction with any of the `go/doc` types may need manual fixes; the
renamed fields will lead to run-time errors.

### The hash package {#hash}

In Go 1, the definition of [`hash.Hash`](/pkg/hash/#Hash) includes a new
method, `BlockSize`. This new method is used primarily in the
cryptographic libraries.

The `Sum` method of the [`hash.Hash`](/pkg/hash/#Hash) interface now
takes a `[]byte` argument, to which the hash value will be appended. The
previous behavior can be recreated by adding a `nil` argument to the
call.

*Updating*: Existing implementations of `hash.Hash` will need to add a
`BlockSize` method. Hashes that process the input one byte at a time can
implement `BlockSize` to return 1. Running `go` `fix` will update calls
to the `Sum` methods of the various implementations of `hash.Hash`.

*Updating*: Since the package's functionality is new, no updating is
necessary.

### The http package {#http}

In Go 1 the [`http`](/pkg/net/http/) package is refactored, putting some
of the utilities into a [`httputil`](/pkg/net/http/httputil/)
subdirectory. These pieces are only rarely needed by HTTP clients. The
affected items are:

- ClientConn
- DumpRequest
- DumpRequestOut
- DumpResponse
- NewChunkedReader
- NewChunkedWriter
- NewClientConn
- NewProxyClientConn
- NewServerConn
- NewSingleHostReverseProxy
- ReverseProxy
- ServerConn

The `Request.RawURL` field has been removed; it was a historical
artifact.

The `Handle` and `HandleFunc` functions, and the similarly-named methods
of `ServeMux`, now panic if an attempt is made to register the same
pattern twice.

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will update the few programs that are
affected except for uses of `RawURL`, which must be fixed by hand.

### The image package {#image}

The [`image`](/pkg/image/) package has had a number of minor changes,
rearrangements and renamings.

Most of the color handling code has been moved into its own package,
[`image/color`](/pkg/image/color/). For the elements that moved, a
symmetry arises; for instance, each pixel of an
[`image.RGBA`](/pkg/image/#RGBA) is a
[`color.RGBA`](/pkg/image/color/#RGBA).

The old `image/ycbcr` package has been folded, with some renamings, into
the [`image`](/pkg/image/) and [`image/color`](/pkg/image/color/)
packages.

The old `image.ColorImage` type is still in the `image` package but has
been renamed [`image.Uniform`](/pkg/image/#Uniform), while `image.Tiled`
has been removed.

This table lists the renamings.

The image package's `New` functions ([`NewRGBA`](/pkg/image/#NewRGBA),
[`NewRGBA64`](/pkg/image/#NewRGBA64), etc.) take an
[`image.Rectangle`](/pkg/image/#Rectangle) as an argument instead of
four integers.

Finally, there are new predefined `color.Color` variables
[`color.Black`](/pkg/image/color/#Black),
[`color.White`](/pkg/image/color/#White),
[`color.Opaque`](/pkg/image/color/#Opaque) and
[`color.Transparent`](/pkg/image/color/#Transparent).

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will update almost all code affected by
the change.

### The log/syslog package {#log_syslog}

In Go 1, the [`syslog.NewLogger`](/pkg/log/syslog/#NewLogger) function
returns an error as well as a `log.Logger`.

*Updating*: What little code is affected will be caught by the compiler
and must be updated by hand.

### The mime package {#mime}

In Go 1, the [`FormatMediaType`](/pkg/mime/#FormatMediaType) function of
the `mime` package has been simplified to make it consistent with
[`ParseMediaType`](/pkg/mime/#ParseMediaType). It now takes
`"text/html"` rather than `"text"` and `"html"`.

*Updating*: What little code is affected will be caught by the compiler
and must be updated by hand.

### The net package {#net}

In Go 1, the various `SetTimeout`, `SetReadTimeout`, and
`SetWriteTimeout` methods have been replaced with
[`SetDeadline`](/pkg/net/#IPConn.SetDeadline),
[`SetReadDeadline`](/pkg/net/#IPConn.SetReadDeadline), and
[`SetWriteDeadline`](/pkg/net/#IPConn.SetWriteDeadline), respectively.
Rather than taking a timeout value in nanoseconds that apply to any
activity on the connection, the new methods set an absolute deadline (as
a `time.Time` value) after which reads and writes will time out and no
longer block.

There are also new functions [`net.DialTimeout`](/pkg/net/#DialTimeout)
to simplify timing out dialing a network address and
[`net.ListenMulticastUDP`](/pkg/net/#ListenMulticastUDP) to allow
multicast UDP to listen concurrently across multiple listeners. The
`net.ListenMulticastUDP` function replaces the old `JoinGroup` and
`LeaveGroup` methods.

*Updating*: Code that uses the old methods will fail to compile and must
be updated by hand. The semantic change makes it difficult for the fix
tool to update automatically.

### The os package {#os}

The `Time` function has been removed; callers should use the
[`Time`](/pkg/time/#Time) type from the `time` package.

The `Exec` function has been removed; callers should use `Exec` from the
`syscall` package, where available.

The `ShellExpand` function has been renamed to
[`ExpandEnv`](/pkg/os/#ExpandEnv).

The [`NewFile`](/pkg/os/#NewFile) function now takes a `uintptr` fd,
instead of an `int`. The [`Fd`](/pkg/os/#File.Fd) method on files now
also returns a `uintptr`.

There are no longer error constants such as `EINVAL` in the `os`
package, since the set of values varied with the underlying operating
system. There are new portable functions like
[`IsPermission`](/pkg/os/#IsPermission) to test common error properties,
plus a few new error values with more Go-like names, such as
[`ErrPermission`](/pkg/os/#ErrPermission) and
[`ErrNotExist`](/pkg/os/#ErrNotExist).

The `Getenverror` function has been removed. To distinguish between a
non-existent environment variable and an empty string, use
[`os.Environ`](/pkg/os/#Environ) or
[`syscall.Getenv`](/pkg/syscall/#Getenv).

The [`Process.Wait`](/pkg/os/#Process.Wait) method has dropped its
option argument and the associated constants are gone from the package.
Also, the function `Wait` is gone; only the method of the `Process` type
persists.

The `Waitmsg` type returned by [`Process.Wait`](/pkg/os/#Process.Wait)
has been replaced with a more portable
[`ProcessState`](/pkg/os/#ProcessState) type with accessor methods to
recover information about the process. Because of changes to `Wait`, the
`ProcessState` value always describes an exited process. Portability
concerns simplified the interface in other ways, but the values returned
by the [`ProcessState.Sys`](/pkg/os/#ProcessState.Sys) and
[`ProcessState.SysUsage`](/pkg/os/#ProcessState.SysUsage) methods can be
type-asserted to underlying system-specific data structures such as
[`syscall.WaitStatus`](/pkg/syscall/#WaitStatus) and
[`syscall.Rusage`](/pkg/syscall/#Rusage) on Unix.

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will drop a zero argument to
`Process.Wait`. All other changes will be caught by the compiler and
must be updated by hand.

#### The os.FileInfo type {#os_fileinfo}

Go 1 redefines the [`os.FileInfo`](/pkg/os/#FileInfo) type, changing it
from a struct to an interface:

        type FileInfo interface {
            Name() string       // base name of the file
            Size() int64        // length in bytes
            Mode() FileMode     // file mode bits
            ModTime() time.Time // modification time
            IsDir() bool        // abbreviation for Mode().IsDir()
            Sys() interface{}   // underlying data source (can return nil)
        }

The file mode information has been moved into a subtype called
[`os.FileMode`](/pkg/os/#FileMode), a simple integer type with `IsDir`,
`Perm`, and `String` methods.

The system-specific details of file modes and properties such as (on
Unix) i-number have been removed from `FileInfo` altogether. Instead,
each operating system's `os` package provides an implementation of the
`FileInfo` interface, which has a `Sys` method that returns the
system-specific representation of file metadata. For instance, to
discover the i-number of a file on a Unix system, unpack the `FileInfo`
like this:

        fi, err := os.Stat("hello.go")
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
        // Check that it's a Unix file.
        unixStat, ok := fi.Sys().(*syscall.Stat_t)
        if !ok {
            log.Fatal("hello.go: not a Unix file")
        }
        fmt.Printf("file i-number: %d\n", unixStat.Ino)

Assuming (which is unwise) that `"hello.go"` is a Unix file, the
i-number expression could be contracted to

        fi.Sys().(*syscall.Stat_t).Ino

The vast majority of uses of `FileInfo` need only the methods of the
standard interface.

The `os` package no longer contains wrappers for the POSIX errors such
as `ENOENT`. For the few programs that need to verify particular error
conditions, there are now the boolean functions
[`IsExist`](/pkg/os/#IsExist), [`IsNotExist`](/pkg/os/#IsNotExist) and
[`IsPermission`](/pkg/os/#IsPermission).

::: code
        f, err := os.OpenFile(name, os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE|os.O_EXCL, 0600)
        if os.IsExist(err) {
            log.Printf("%s already exists", name)
        }
:::

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will update code that uses the old
equivalent of the current `os.FileInfo` and `os.FileMode` API. Code that
needs system-specific file details will need to be updated by hand. Code
that uses the old POSIX error values from the `os` package will fail to
compile and will also need to be updated by hand.

### The os/signal package {#os_signal}

The `os/signal` package in Go 1 replaces the `Incoming` function, which
returned a channel that received all incoming signals, with the
selective `Notify` function, which asks for delivery of specific signals
on an existing channel.

*Updating*: Code must be updated by hand. A literal translation of

    c := signal.Incoming()

is

    c := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
    signal.Notify(c) // ask for all signals

but most code should list the specific signals it wants to handle
instead:

    c := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
    signal.Notify(c, syscall.SIGHUP, syscall.SIGQUIT)

### The path/filepath package {#path_filepath}

In Go 1, the [`Walk`](/pkg/path/filepath/#Walk) function of the
`path/filepath` package has been changed to take a function value of
type [`WalkFunc`](/pkg/path/filepath/#WalkFunc) instead of a `Visitor`
interface value. `WalkFunc` unifies the handling of both files and
directories.

        type WalkFunc func(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error

The `WalkFunc` function will be called even for files or directories
that could not be opened; in such cases the error argument will describe
the failure. If a directory's contents are to be skipped, the function
should return the value
[`filepath.SkipDir`](/pkg/path/filepath/#pkg-variables)

::: code
        markFn := func(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error {
            if path == "pictures" { // Will skip walking of directory pictures and its contents.
                return filepath.SkipDir
            }
            if err != nil {
                return err
            }
            log.Println(path)
            return nil
        }
        err := filepath.Walk(".", markFn)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
:::

*Updating*: The change simplifies most code but has subtle consequences,
so affected programs will need to be updated by hand. The compiler will
catch code using the old interface.

### The regexp package {#regexp}

The [`regexp`](/pkg/regexp/) package has been rewritten. It has the same
interface but the specification of the regular expressions it supports
has changed from the old "egrep" form to that of
[RE2](https://code.google.com/p/re2/){rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"}.

*Updating*: Code that uses the package should have its regular
expressions checked by hand.

### The runtime package {#runtime}

In Go 1, much of the API exported by package `runtime` has been removed
in favor of functionality provided by other packages. Code using the
`runtime.Type` interface or its specific concrete type implementations
should now use package [`reflect`](/pkg/reflect/). Code using
`runtime.Semacquire` or `runtime.Semrelease` should use channels or the
abstractions in package [`sync`](/pkg/sync/). The `runtime.Alloc`,
`runtime.Free`, and `runtime.Lookup` functions, an unsafe API created
for debugging the memory allocator, have no replacement.

Before, `runtime.MemStats` was a global variable holding statistics
about memory allocation, and calls to `runtime.UpdateMemStats` ensured
that it was up to date. In Go 1, `runtime.MemStats` is a struct type,
and code should use [`runtime.ReadMemStats`](/pkg/runtime/#ReadMemStats)
to obtain the current statistics.

The package adds a new function,
[`runtime.NumCPU`](/pkg/runtime/#NumCPU), that returns the number of
CPUs available for parallel execution, as reported by the operating
system kernel. Its value can inform the setting of `GOMAXPROCS`. The
`runtime.Cgocalls` and `runtime.Goroutines` functions have been renamed
to `runtime.NumCgoCall` and `runtime.NumGoroutine`.

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will update code for the function
renamings. Other code will need to be updated by hand.

### The strconv package {#strconv}

In Go 1, the [`strconv`](/pkg/strconv/) package has been significantly
reworked to make it more Go-like and less C-like, although `Atoi` lives
on (it's similar to `int(ParseInt(x, 10, 0))`, as does `Itoa(x)`
(`FormatInt(int64(x), 10)`). There are also new variants of some of the
functions that append to byte slices rather than return strings, to
allow control over allocation.

This table summarizes the renamings; see the [package
documentation](/pkg/strconv/) for full details.

*Updating*: Running `go` `fix` will update almost all code affected by
the change.\
§ `Atoi` persists but `Atoui` and `Atof32` do not, so they may require a
cast that must be added by hand; the `go` `fix` tool will warn about it.

### The template packages {#templates}

The `template` and `exp/template/html` packages have moved to
[`text/template`](/pkg/text/template/) and
[`html/template`](/pkg/html/template/). More significant, the interface
to these packages has been simplified. The template language is the
same, but the concept of "template set" is gone and the functions and
methods of the packages have changed accordingly, often by elimination.

Instead of sets, a `Template` object may contain multiple named template
definitions, in effect constructing name spaces for template invocation.
A template can invoke any other template associated with it, but only
those templates associated with it. The simplest way to associate
templates is to parse them together, something made easier with the new
structure of the packages.

*Updating*: The imports will be updated by fix tool. Single-template
uses will be otherwise be largely unaffected. Code that uses multiple
templates in concert will need to be updated by hand. The
[examples](/pkg/text/template/#pkg-examples) in the documentation for
`text/template` can provide guidance.

### The testing package {#testing}

The testing package has a type, `B`, passed as an argument to benchmark
functions. In Go 1, `B` has new methods, analogous to those of `T`,
enabling logging and failure reporting.

::: code
    func BenchmarkSprintf(b *testing.B) {
        // Verify correctness before running benchmark.
        b.StopTimer()
        got := fmt.Sprintf("%x", 23)
        const expect = "17"
        if expect != got {
            b.Fatalf("expected %q; got %q", expect, got)
        }
        b.StartTimer()
        for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
            fmt.Sprintf("%x", 23)
        }
    }
:::

*Updating*: Existing code is unaffected, although benchmarks that use
`println` or `panic` should be updated to use the new methods.

### The testing/script package {#testing_script}

The testing/script package has been deleted. It was a dreg.

*Updating*: No code is likely to be affected.

### The unsafe package {#unsafe}

In Go 1, the functions `unsafe.Typeof`, `unsafe.Reflect`,
`unsafe.Unreflect`, `unsafe.New`, and `unsafe.NewArray` have been
removed; they duplicated safer functionality provided by package
[`reflect`](/pkg/reflect/).

*Updating*: Code using these functions must be rewritten to use package
[`reflect`](/pkg/reflect/). The changes to
[encoding/gob](/change/2646dc956207) and the [protocol buffer
library](https://code.google.com/p/goprotobuf/source/detail?r=5340ad310031){rel="noreferrer"

### The url package {#url}

In Go 1 several fields from the [`url.URL`](/pkg/net/url/#URL) type were
removed or replaced.

The [`String`](/pkg/net/url/#URL.String) method now predictably rebuilds
an encoded URL string using all of `URL`'s fields as necessary. The
resulting string will also no longer have passwords escaped.

The `Raw` field has been removed. In most cases the `String` method may
be used in its place.

The old `RawUserinfo` field is replaced by the `User` field, of type
[`*net.Userinfo`](/pkg/net/url/#Userinfo). Values of this type may be
created using the new [`net.User`](/pkg/net/url/#User) and
[`net.UserPassword`](/pkg/net/url/#UserPassword) functions. The
`EscapeUserinfo` and `UnescapeUserinfo` functions are also gone.

The `RawAuthority` field has been removed. The same information is
available in the `Host` and `User` fields.

The `RawPath` field and the `EncodedPath` method have been removed. The
path information in rooted URLs (with a slash following the schema) is
now available only in decoded form in the `Path` field. Occasionally,
the encoded data may be required to obtain information that was lost in
the decoding process. These cases must be handled by accessing the data
the URL was built from.

URLs with non-rooted paths, such as
`"mailto:dev@golang.org?subject=Hi"`, are also handled differently. The
`OpaquePath` boolean field has been removed and a new `Opaque` string
field introduced to hold the encoded path for such URLs. In Go 1, the
cited URL parses as:

        URL{
            Scheme: "mailto",
            Opaque: "dev@golang.org",
            RawQuery: "subject=Hi",
        }

A new [`RequestURI`](/pkg/net/url/#URL.RequestURI) method was added to
`URL`.

The `ParseWithReference` function has been renamed to
`ParseWithFragment`.

*Updating*: Code that uses the old fields will fail to compile and must
be updated by hand. The semantic changes make it difficult for the fix
tool to update automatically.

## The go command {#cmd_go}

Go 1 introduces the [go command](/cmd/go/), a tool for fetching,
building, and installing Go packages and commands. The `go` command does
away with makefiles, instead using Go source code to find dependencies
and determine build conditions. Most existing Go programs will no longer
require makefiles to be built.

See [How to Write Go Code](/doc/code.html) for a primer on the `go`
command and the [go command documentation](/cmd/go/) for the full
details.

*Updating*: Projects that depend on the Go project's old makefile-based
build infrastructure (`Make.pkg`, `Make.cmd`, and so on) should switch
to using the `go` command for building Go code and, if necessary,
rewrite their makefiles to perform any auxiliary build tasks.

## The cgo command {#cmd_cgo}

In Go 1, the [cgo command](/cmd/cgo) uses a different `_cgo_export.h`
file, which is generated for packages containing `//export` lines. The
`_cgo_export.h` file now begins with the C preamble comment, so that
exported function definitions can use types defined there. This has the
effect of compiling the preamble multiple times, so a package using
`//export` must not put function definitions or variable initializations
in the C preamble.

## Packaged releases {#releases}

One of the most significant changes associated with Go 1 is the
availability of prepackaged, downloadable distributions. They are
available for many combinations of architecture and operating system
(including Windows) and the list will grow. Installation details are
described on the [Getting Started](/doc/install) page, while the
distributions themselves are listed on the [downloads page](/dl/).
