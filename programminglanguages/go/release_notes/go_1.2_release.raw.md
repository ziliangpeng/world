## Introduction to Go 1.2 {#introduction}

Since the release of [Go version 1.1](/doc/go1.1.html) in April, 2013,
the release schedule has been shortened to make the release process more
efficient. This release, Go version 1.2 or Go 1.2 for short, arrives
roughly six months after 1.1, while 1.1 took over a year to appear after
1.0. Because of the shorter time scale, 1.2 is a smaller delta than the
step from 1.0 to 1.1, but it still has some significant developments,
including a better scheduler and one new language feature. Of course, Go
1.2 keeps the [promise of compatibility](/doc/go1compat.html). The
overwhelming majority of programs built with Go 1.1 (or 1.0 for that
matter) will run without any changes whatsoever when moved to 1.2,
although the introduction of one restriction to a corner of the language
may expose already-incorrect code (see the discussion of the [use of
nil](#use_of_nil)).

## Changes to the language {#language}

In the interest of firming up the specification, one corner case has
been clarified, with consequences for programs. There is also one new
language feature.

### Use of nil {#use_of_nil}

The language now specifies that, for safety reasons, certain uses of nil
pointers are guaranteed to trigger a run-time panic. For instance, in Go
1.0, given code like

    type T struct {
        X [1<<24]byte
        Field int32
    }

    func main() {
        var x *T
        ...
    }

the `nil` pointer `x` could be used to access memory incorrectly: the
expression `x.Field` could access memory at address `1<<24`. To prevent
such unsafe behavior, in Go 1.2 the compilers now guarantee that any
indirection through a nil pointer, such as illustrated here but also in
nil pointers to arrays, nil interface values, nil slices, and so on,
will either panic or return a correct, safe non-nil value. In short, any
expression that explicitly or implicitly requires evaluation of a nil
address is an error. The implementation may inject extra tests into the
compiled program to enforce this behavior.

Further details are in the [design document](/s/go12nil).

*Updating*: Most code that depended on the old behavior is erroneous and
will fail when run. Such programs will need to be updated by hand.

### Three-index slices {#three_index}

Go 1.2 adds the ability to specify the capacity as well as the length
when using a slicing operation on an existing array or slice. A slicing
operation creates a new slice by describing a contiguous section of an
already-created array or slice:

    var array [10]int
    slice := array[2:4]

The capacity of the slice is the maximum number of elements that the
slice may hold, even after reslicing; it reflects the size of the
underlying array. In this example, the capacity of the `slice` variable
is 8.

Go 1.2 adds new syntax to allow a slicing operation to specify the
capacity as well as the length. A second colon introduces the capacity
value, which must be less than or equal to the capacity of the source
slice or array, adjusted for the origin. For instance,

    slice = array[2:4:7]

sets the slice to have the same length as in the earlier example but its
capacity is now only 5 elements (7-2). It is impossible to use this new
slice value to access the last three elements of the original array.

In this three-index notation, a missing first index (`[:i:j]`) defaults
to zero but the other two indices must always be specified explicitly.
It is possible that future releases of Go may introduce default values
for these indices.

Further details are in the [design document](/s/go12slice).

*Updating*: This is a backwards-compatible change that affects no
existing programs.

## Changes to the implementations and tools {#impl}

### Pre-emption in the scheduler {#preemption}

In prior releases, a goroutine that was looping forever could starve out
other goroutines on the same thread, a serious problem when GOMAXPROCS
provided only one user thread. In Go 1.2, this is partially addressed:
The scheduler is invoked occasionally upon entry to a function. This
means that any loop that includes a (non-inlined) function call can be
pre-empted, allowing other goroutines to run on the same thread.

### Limit on the number of threads {#thread_limit}

Go 1.2 introduces a configurable limit (default 10,000) to the total
number of threads a single program may have in its address space, to
avoid resource starvation issues in some environments. Note that
goroutines are multiplexed onto threads so this limit does not directly
limit the number of goroutines, only the number that may be
simultaneously blocked in a system call. In practice, the limit is hard
to reach.

The new [`SetMaxThreads`](/pkg/runtime/debug/#SetMaxThreads) function in
the [`runtime/debug`](/pkg/runtime/debug/) package controls the thread
count limit.

*Updating*: Few functions will be affected by the limit, but if a
program dies because it hits the limit, it could be modified to call
`SetMaxThreads` to set a higher count. Even better would be to refactor
the program to need fewer threads, reducing consumption of kernel
resources.

### Stack size {#stack_size}

In Go 1.2, the minimum size of the stack when a goroutine is created has
been lifted from 4KB to 8KB. Many programs were suffering performance
problems with the old size, which had a tendency to introduce expensive
stack-segment switching in performance-critical sections. The new number
was determined by empirical testing.

At the other end, the new function
[`SetMaxStack`](/pkg/runtime/debug/#SetMaxStack) in the
[`runtime/debug`](/pkg/runtime/debug) package controls the *maximum*
size of a single goroutine's stack. The default is 1GB on 64-bit systems
and 250MB on 32-bit systems. Before Go 1.2, it was too easy for a
runaway recursion to consume all the memory on a machine.

*Updating*: The increased minimum stack size may cause programs with
many goroutines to use more memory. There is no workaround, but plans
for future releases include new stack management technology that should
address the problem better.

### Cgo and C++ {#cgo_and_cpp}

The [`cgo`](/cmd/cgo/) command will now invoke the C++ compiler to build
any pieces of the linked-to library that are written in C++; [the
documentation](/cmd/cgo/) has more detail.

### Godoc and vet moved to the go.tools subrepository {#go_tools_godoc}

Both binaries are still included with the distribution, but the source
code for the godoc and vet commands has moved to the
[go.tools](https://code.google.com/p/go.tools){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} subrepository.

Also, the core of the godoc program has been split into a
[library](https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/?repo=tools#hg%2Fgodoc){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"}, while the command itself is in a separate
[directory](https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/?repo=tools#hg%2Fcmd%2Fgodoc){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"}. The move allows the code to be updated easily and the
separation into a library and command makes it easier to construct
custom binaries for local sites and different deployment methods.

*Updating*: Since godoc and vet are not part of the library, no client
Go code depends on their source and no updating is required.

The binary distributions available from [golang.org](/) include these
binaries, so users of these distributions are unaffected.

When building from source, users must use "go get" to install godoc and
vet. (The binaries will continue to be installed in their usual
locations, not `$GOPATH/bin`.)

    $ go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc
    $ go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/vet

### Status of gccgo {#gccgo}

We expect the future GCC 4.9 release to include gccgo with full support
for Go 1.2. In the current (4.8.2) release of GCC, gccgo implements Go
1.1.2.

### Changes to the gc compiler and linker {#gc_changes}

Go 1.2 has several semantic changes to the workings of the gc compiler
suite. Most users will be unaffected by them.

The [`cgo`](/cmd/cgo/) command now works when C++ is included in the
library being linked against. See the [`cgo`](/cmd/cgo/) documentation
for details.

The gc compiler displayed a vestigial detail of its origins when a
program had no `package` clause: it assumed the file was in package
`main`. The past has been erased, and a missing `package` clause is now
an error.

On the ARM, the toolchain supports "external linking", which is a step
towards being able to build shared libraries with the gc toolchain and
to provide dynamic linking support for environments in which that is
necessary.

In the runtime for the ARM, with `5a`, it used to be possible to refer
to the runtime-internal `m` (machine) and `g` (goroutine) variables
using `R9` and `R10` directly. It is now necessary to refer to them by
their proper names.

Also on the ARM, the `5l` linker (sic) now defines the `MOVBS` and
`MOVHS` instructions as synonyms of `MOVB` and `MOVH`, to make clearer
the separation between signed and unsigned sub-word moves; the unsigned
versions already existed with a `U` suffix.

### Test coverage {#cover}

One major new feature of [`go test`](/pkg/go/) is that it can now
compute and, with help from a new, separately installed "go tool cover"
program, display test coverage results.

The cover tool is part of the
[`go.tools`](https://code.google.com/p/go/source/checkout?repo=tools){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} subrepository. It can be installed by running

    $ go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/cover

The cover tool does two things. First, when "go test" is given the
`-cover` flag, it is run automatically to rewrite the source for the
package and insert instrumentation statements. The test is then compiled
and run as usual, and basic coverage statistics are reported:

    $ go test -cover fmt
    ok      fmt 0.060s  coverage: 91.4% of statements
    $

Second, for more detailed reports, different flags to "go test" can
create a coverage profile file, which the cover program, invoked with
"go tool cover", can then analyze.

Details on how to generate and analyze coverage statistics can be found
by running the commands

    $ go help testflag
    $ go tool cover -help

### The go doc command is deleted {#go_doc}

The "go doc" command is deleted. Note that the [`godoc`](/cmd/godoc/)
tool itself is not deleted, just the wrapping of it by the
[`go`](/cmd/go/) command. All it did was show the documents for a
package by package path, which godoc itself already does with more
flexibility. It has therefore been deleted to reduce the number of
documentation tools and, as part of the restructuring of godoc,
encourage better options in future.

*Updating*: For those who still need the precise functionality of
running

    $ go doc

in a directory, the behavior is identical to running

    $ godoc .

### Changes to the go command {#gocmd}

The [`go get`](/cmd/go/) command now has a `-t` flag that causes it to
download the dependencies of the tests run by the package, not just
those of the package itself. By default, as before, dependencies of the
tests are not downloaded.

## Performance

There are a number of significant performance improvements in the
standard library; here are a few of them.

- The [`compress/bzip2`](/pkg/compress/bzip2/) decompresses about 30%
  faster.
- The [`crypto/des`](/pkg/crypto/des/) package is about five times
  faster.
- The [`encoding/json`](/pkg/encoding/json/) package encodes about 30%
  faster.
- Networking performance on Windows and BSD systems is about 30% faster
  through the use of an integrated network poller in the runtime,
  similar to what was done for Linux and OS X in Go 1.1.

## Changes to the standard library {#library}

### The archive/tar and archive/zip packages {#archive_tar_zip}

The [`archive/tar`](/pkg/archive/tar/) and
[`archive/zip`](/pkg/archive/zip/) packages have had a change to their
semantics that may break existing programs. The issue is that they both
provided an implementation of the [`os.FileInfo`](/pkg/os/#FileInfo)
interface that was not compliant with the specification for that
interface. In particular, their `Name` method returned the full path
name of the entry, but the interface specification requires that the
method return only the base name (final path element).

*Updating*: Since this behavior was newly implemented and a bit obscure,
it is possible that no code depends on the broken behavior. If there are
programs that do depend on it, they will need to be identified and fixed
manually.

### The new encoding package {#encoding}

There is a new package, [`encoding`](/pkg/encoding/), that defines a set
of standard encoding interfaces that may be used to build custom
marshalers and unmarshalers for packages such as
[`encoding/xml`](/pkg/encoding/xml/),
[`encoding/json`](/pkg/encoding/json/), and
[`encoding/binary`](/pkg/encoding/binary/). These new interfaces have
been used to tidy up some implementations in the standard library.

The new interfaces are called
[`BinaryMarshaler`](/pkg/encoding/#BinaryMarshaler),
[`BinaryUnmarshaler`](/pkg/encoding/#BinaryUnmarshaler),
[`TextMarshaler`](/pkg/encoding/#TextMarshaler), and
[`TextUnmarshaler`](/pkg/encoding/#TextUnmarshaler). Full details are in
the [documentation](/pkg/encoding/) for the package and a separate
[design document](/s/go12encoding).

### The fmt package {#fmt_indexed_arguments}

The [`fmt`](/pkg/fmt/) package's formatted print routines such as
[`Printf`](/pkg/fmt/#Printf) now allow the data items to be printed to
be accessed in arbitrary order by using an indexing operation in the
formatting specifications. Wherever an argument is to be fetched from
the argument list for formatting, either as the value to be formatted or
as a width or specification integer, a new optional indexing notation
`[`*n*`]` fetches argument *n* instead. The value of *n* is 1-indexed.
After such an indexing operating, the next argument to be fetched by
normal processing will be *n*+1.

For example, the normal `Printf` call

    fmt.Sprintf("%c %c %c\n", 'a', 'b', 'c')

would create the string `"a b c"`, but with indexing operations like
this,

    fmt.Sprintf("%[3]c %[1]c %c\n", 'a', 'b', 'c')

the result is "`"c a b"`. The `[3]` index accesses the third formatting
argument, which is `'c'`, `[1]` accesses the first, `'a'`, and then the
next fetch accesses the argument following that one, `'b'`.

The motivation for this feature is programmable format statements to
access the arguments in different order for localization, but it has
other uses:

    log.Printf("trace: value %v of type %[1]T\n", expensiveFunction(a.b[c]))

*Updating*: The change to the syntax of format specifications is
strictly backwards compatible, so it affects no working programs.

### The text/template and html/template packages {#text_template}

The [`text/template`](/pkg/text/template/) package has a couple of
changes in Go 1.2, both of which are also mirrored in the
[`html/template`](/pkg/html/template/) package.

First, there are new default functions for comparing basic types. The
functions are listed in this table, which shows their names and the
associated familiar comparison operator.

  -- ------ ----------
     Name   Operator
     `eq`   `==`
     `ne`   `!=`
     `lt`   `<`
     `le`   `<=`
     `gt`   `>`
     `ge`   `>=`
  -- ------ ----------

These functions behave slightly differently from the corresponding Go
operators. First, they operate only on basic types (`bool`, `int`,
`float64`, `string`, etc.). (Go allows comparison of arrays and structs
as well, under some circumstances.) Second, values can be compared as
long as they are the same sort of value: any signed integer value can be
compared to any other signed integer value for example. (Go does not
permit comparing an `int8` and an `int16`). Finally, the `eq` function
(only) allows comparison of the first argument with one or more
following arguments. The template in this example,

    {{if eq .A 1 2 3}} equal {{else}} not equal {{end}}

reports "equal" if `.A` is equal to *any* of 1, 2, or 3.

The second change is that a small addition to the grammar makes "if else
if" chains easier to write. Instead of writing,

    {{if eq .A 1}} X {{else}} {{if eq .A 2}} Y {{end}} {{end}}

one can fold the second "if" into the "else" and have only one "end",
like this:

    {{if eq .A 1}} X {{else if eq .A 2}} Y {{end}}

The two forms are identical in effect; the difference is just in the
syntax.

*Updating*: Neither the "else if" change nor the comparison functions
affect existing programs. Those that already define functions called
`eq` and so on through a function map are unaffected because the
associated function map will override the new default function
definitions.

### New packages {#new_packages}

There are two new packages.

- The [`encoding`](/pkg/encoding/) package is [described
  above](#encoding).
- The [`image/color/palette`](/pkg/image/color/palette/) package
  provides standard color palettes.

### Minor changes to the library {#minor_library_changes}

The following list summarizes a number of minor changes to the library,
mostly additions. See the relevant package documentation for more
information about each change.

- The [`archive/zip`](/pkg/archive/zip/) package adds the
  [`DataOffset`](/pkg/archive/zip/#File.DataOffset) accessor to return
  the offset of a file's (possibly compressed) data within the archive.
- The [`bufio`](/pkg/bufio/) package adds
  [`Reset`](/pkg/bufio/#Reader.Reset) methods to
  [`Reader`](/pkg/bufio/#Reader) and [`Writer`](/pkg/bufio/#Writer).
  These methods allow the [`Readers`](/pkg/io/#Reader) and
  [`Writers`](/pkg/io/#Writer) to be re-used on new input and output
  readers and writers, saving allocation overhead.
- The [`compress/bzip2`](/pkg/compress/bzip2/) can now decompress
  concatenated archives.
- The [`compress/flate`](/pkg/compress/flate/) package adds a
  [`Reset`](/pkg/compress/flate/#Writer.Reset) method on the
  [`Writer`](/pkg/compress/flate/#Writer), to make it possible to reduce
  allocation when, for instance, constructing an archive to hold
  multiple compressed files.
- The [`compress/gzip`](/pkg/compress/gzip/) package's
  [`Writer`](/pkg/compress/gzip/#Writer) type adds a
  [`Reset`](/pkg/compress/gzip/#Writer.Reset) so it may be reused.
- The [`compress/zlib`](/pkg/compress/zlib/) package's
  [`Writer`](/pkg/compress/zlib/#Writer) type adds a
  [`Reset`](/pkg/compress/zlib/#Writer.Reset) so it may be reused.
- The [`container/heap`](/pkg/container/heap/) package adds a
  [`Fix`](/pkg/container/heap/#Fix) method to provide a more efficient
  way to update an item's position in the heap.
- The [`container/list`](/pkg/container/list/) package adds the
  [`MoveBefore`](/pkg/container/list/#List.MoveBefore) and
  [`MoveAfter`](/pkg/container/list/#List.MoveAfter) methods, which
  implement the obvious rearrangement.
- The [`crypto/cipher`](/pkg/crypto/cipher/) package adds the new GCM
  mode (Galois Counter Mode), which is almost always used with AES
  encryption.
- The [`crypto/md5`](/pkg/crypto/md5/) package adds a new
  [`Sum`](/pkg/crypto/md5/#Sum) function to simplify hashing without
  sacrificing performance.
- Similarly, the [`crypto/sha1`](/pkg/crypto/md5/) package adds a new
  [`Sum`](/pkg/crypto/sha1/#Sum) function.
- Also, the [`crypto/sha256`](/pkg/crypto/sha256/) package adds
  [`Sum256`](/pkg/crypto/sha256/#Sum256) and
  [`Sum224`](/pkg/crypto/sha256/#Sum224) functions.
- Finally, the [`crypto/sha512`](/pkg/crypto/sha512/) package adds
  [`Sum512`](/pkg/crypto/sha512/#Sum512) and
  [`Sum384`](/pkg/crypto/sha512/#Sum384) functions.
- The [`crypto/x509`](/pkg/crypto/x509/) package adds support for
  reading and writing arbitrary extensions.
- The [`crypto/tls`](/pkg/crypto/tls/) package adds support for TLS 1.1,
  1.2 and AES-GCM.
- The [`database/sql`](/pkg/database/sql/) package adds a
  [`SetMaxOpenConns`](/pkg/database/sql/#DB.SetMaxOpenConns) method on
  [`DB`](/pkg/database/sql/#DB) to limit the number of open connections
  to the database.
- The [`encoding/csv`](/pkg/encoding/csv/) package now always allows
  trailing commas on fields.
- The [`encoding/gob`](/pkg/encoding/gob/) package now treats channel
  and function fields of structures as if they were unexported, even if
  they are not. That is, it ignores them completely. Previously they
  would trigger an error, which could cause unexpected compatibility
  problems if an embedded structure added such a field. The package also
  now supports the generic `BinaryMarshaler` and `BinaryUnmarshaler`
  interfaces of the [`encoding`](/pkg/encoding/) package described
  above.
- The [`encoding/json`](/pkg/encoding/json/) package now will always
  escape ampersands as "\\u0026" when printing strings. It will now
  accept but correct invalid UTF-8 in
  [`Marshal`](/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshal) (such input was previously
  rejected). Finally, it now supports the generic encoding interfaces of
  the [`encoding`](/pkg/encoding/) package described above.
- The [`encoding/xml`](/pkg/encoding/xml/) package now allows attributes
  stored in pointers to be marshaled. It also supports the generic
  encoding interfaces of the [`encoding`](/pkg/encoding/) package
  described above through the new
  [`Marshaler`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Marshaler),
  [`Unmarshaler`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Unmarshaler), and related
  [`MarshalerAttr`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#MarshalerAttr) and
  [`UnmarshalerAttr`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#UnmarshalerAttr) interfaces.
  The package also adds a [`Flush`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Encoder.Flush)
  method to the [`Encoder`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Encoder) type for use by
  custom encoders. See the documentation for
  [`EncodeToken`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Encoder.EncodeToken) to see how to
  use it.
- The [`flag`](/pkg/flag/) package now has a
  [`Getter`](/pkg/flag/#Getter) interface to allow the value of a flag
  to be retrieved. Due to the Go 1 compatibility guidelines, this method
  cannot be added to the existing [`Value`](/pkg/flag/#Value) interface,
  but all the existing standard flag types implement it. The package
  also now exports the [`CommandLine`](/pkg/flag/#CommandLine) flag set,
  which holds the flags from the command line.
- The [`go/ast`](/pkg/go/ast/) package's
  [`SliceExpr`](/pkg/go/ast/#SliceExpr) struct has a new boolean field,
  `Slice3`, which is set to true when representing a slice expression
  with three indices (two colons). The default is false, representing
  the usual two-index form.
- The [`go/build`](/pkg/go/build/) package adds the `AllTags` field to
  the [`Package`](/pkg/go/build/#Package) type, to make it easier to
  process build tags.
- The [`image/draw`](/pkg/image/draw/) package now exports an interface,
  [`Drawer`](/pkg/image/draw/#Drawer), that wraps the standard
  [`Draw`](/pkg/image/draw/#Draw) method. The Porter-Duff operators now
  implement this interface, in effect binding an operation to the draw
  operator rather than providing it explicitly. Given a paletted image
  as its destination, the new
  [`FloydSteinberg`](/pkg/image/draw/#FloydSteinberg) implementation of
  the [`Drawer`](/pkg/image/draw/#Drawer) interface will use the
  Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion algorithm to draw the image. To create
  palettes suitable for such processing, the new
  [`Quantizer`](/pkg/image/draw/#Quantizer) interface represents
  implementations of quantization algorithms that choose a palette given
  a full-color image. There are no implementations of this interface in
  the library.
- The [`image/gif`](/pkg/image/gif/) package can now create GIF files
  using the new [`Encode`](/pkg/image/gif/#Encode) and
  [`EncodeAll`](/pkg/image/gif/#EncodeAll) functions. Their options
  argument allows specification of an image
  [`Quantizer`](/pkg/image/draw/#Quantizer) to use; if it is `nil`, the
  generated GIF will use the [`Plan9`](/pkg/image/color/palette/#Plan9)
  color map (palette) defined in the new
  [`image/color/palette`](/pkg/image/color/palette/) package. The
  options also specify a [`Drawer`](/pkg/image/draw/#Drawer) to use to
  create the output image; if it is `nil`, Floyd-Steinberg error
  diffusion is used.
- The [`Copy`](/pkg/io/#Copy) method of the [`io`](/pkg/io/) package now
  prioritizes its arguments differently. If one argument implements
  [`WriterTo`](/pkg/io/#WriterTo) and the other implements
  [`ReaderFrom`](/pkg/io/#ReaderFrom), [`Copy`](/pkg/io/#Copy) will now
  invoke [`WriterTo`](/pkg/io/#WriterTo) to do the work, so that less
  intermediate buffering is required in general.
- The [`net`](/pkg/net/) package requires cgo by default because the
  host operating system must in general mediate network call setup. On
  some systems, though, it is possible to use the network without cgo,
  and useful to do so, for instance to avoid dynamic linking. The new
  build tag `netgo` (off by default) allows the construction of a `net`
  package in pure Go on those systems where it is possible.
- The [`net`](/pkg/net/) package adds a new field `DualStack` to the
  [`Dialer`](/pkg/net/#Dialer) struct for TCP connection setup using a
  dual IP stack as described in [RFC
  6555](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555){rel="noreferrer"
  target="_blank"}.
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package will no longer transmit
  cookies that are incorrect according to [RFC
  6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265){rel="noreferrer"
  target="_blank"}. It just logs an error and sends nothing. Also, the
  [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package's
  [`ReadResponse`](/pkg/net/http/#ReadResponse) function now permits the
  `*Request` parameter to be `nil`, whereupon it assumes a GET request.
  Finally, an HTTP server will now serve HEAD requests transparently,
  without the need for special casing in handler code. While serving a
  HEAD request, writes to a [`Handler`](/pkg/net/http/#Handler)'s
  [`ResponseWriter`](/pkg/net/http/#ResponseWriter) are absorbed by the
  [`Server`](/pkg/net/http/#Server) and the client receives an empty
  body as required by the HTTP specification.
- The [`os/exec`](/pkg/os/exec/) package's
  [`Cmd.StdinPipe`](/pkg/os/exec/#Cmd.StdinPipe) method returns an
  `io.WriteCloser`, but has changed its concrete implementation from
  `*os.File` to an unexported type that embeds `*os.File`, and it is now
  safe to close the returned value. Before Go 1.2, there was an
  unavoidable race that this change fixes. Code that needs access to the
  methods of `*os.File` can use an interface type assertion, such as
  `wc.(interface{ Sync() error })`.
- The [`runtime`](/pkg/runtime/) package relaxes the constraints on
  finalizer functions in [`SetFinalizer`](/pkg/runtime/#SetFinalizer):
  the actual argument can now be any type that is assignable to the
  formal type of the function, as is the case for any normal function
  call in Go.
- The [`sort`](/pkg/sort/) package has a new
  [`Stable`](/pkg/sort/#Stable) function that implements stable sorting.
  It is less efficient than the normal sort algorithm, however.
- The [`strings`](/pkg/strings/) package adds an
  [`IndexByte`](/pkg/strings/#IndexByte) function for consistency with
  the [`bytes`](/pkg/bytes/) package.
- The [`sync/atomic`](/pkg/sync/atomic/) package adds a new set of swap
  functions that atomically exchange the argument with the value stored
  in the pointer, returning the old value. The functions are
  [`SwapInt32`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#SwapInt32),
  [`SwapInt64`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#SwapInt64),
  [`SwapUint32`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#SwapUint32),
  [`SwapUint64`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#SwapUint64),
  [`SwapUintptr`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#SwapUintptr), and
  [`SwapPointer`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#SwapPointer), which swaps an
  `unsafe.Pointer`.
- The [`syscall`](/pkg/syscall/) package now implements
  [`Sendfile`](/pkg/syscall/#Sendfile) for Darwin.
- The [`testing`](/pkg/testing/) package now exports the
  [`TB`](/pkg/testing/#TB) interface. It records the methods in common
  with the [`T`](/pkg/testing/#T) and [`B`](/pkg/testing/#B) types, to
  make it easier to share code between tests and benchmarks. Also, the
  [`AllocsPerRun`](/pkg/testing/#AllocsPerRun) function now quantizes
  the return value to an integer (although it still has type `float64`),
  to round off any error caused by initialization and make the result
  more repeatable.
- The [`text/template`](/pkg/text/template/) package now automatically
  dereferences pointer values when evaluating the arguments to "escape"
  functions such as "html", to bring the behavior of such functions in
  agreement with that of other printing functions such as "printf".
- In the [`time`](/pkg/time/) package, the [`Parse`](/pkg/time/#Parse)
  function and [`Format`](/pkg/time/#Time.Format) method now handle time
  zone offsets with seconds, such as in the historical date
  "1871-01-01T05:33:02+00:34:08". Also, pattern matching in the formats
  for those routines is stricter: a non-lowercase letter must now follow
  the standard words such as "Jan" and "Mon".
- The [`unicode`](/pkg/unicode/) package adds [`In`](/pkg/unicode/#In),
  a nicer-to-use but equivalent version of the original
  [`IsOneOf`](/pkg/unicode/#IsOneOf), to see whether a character is a
  member of a Unicode category.
