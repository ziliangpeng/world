### Summary of Go 1.21

Go 1.21 added new built-in functions (`min`, `max`, `clear`), introduced new generic packages (`slices`, `maps`, `cmp`), and added a structured logging package (`slog`). It also improved toolchain management for better compatibility.

**Language Features & Syntax**
*   Three new built-in functions were added: `min` and `max` for ordered types, and `clear` for maps and slices.
*   Type inference for generic functions was significantly improved, making generic code easier to write.
*   The package initialization order is now formally defined.

**Performance Improvements**
*   **Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)** is now ready for general use and enabled by default if a `default.pgo` file is present. It improves performance for a representative set of Go programs by 2-7%.
*   The compiler itself is up to 6% faster due to being built with PGO.
*   Runtime tuning can reduce application tail latency by up to 40%.
*   The overhead of repeated C-to-Go calls on the same thread is dramatically reduced.

**Tooling & Developer Experience**
*   **Toolchain Management:** The `go` command can now manage and invoke different Go toolchain versions automatically based on `go.mod` and `go.work` files.
*   **Backward Compatibility:** Building code with an older `go` version specified in `go.mod` (e.g., `go 1.20`) will now preserve the behavior of that Go version, even when using the Go 1.21 toolchain.

**Major Library Updates**
*   A new **`log/slog`** package was added for structured, leveled logging.
*   New generic packages were added:
    *   **`slices`**: Provides a suite of functions for working with slices of any type.
    *   **`maps`**: Provides helper functions for working with maps of any type.
    *   **`cmp`**: Defines the `Ordered` constraint for generic code.
