## Release Policy {#policy}

Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major
releases. For example, Go 1.5 was supported until the Go 1.7 release,
and Go 1.6 was supported until the Go 1.8 release. We fix critical
problems, including [critical security problems](/security), in
supported releases as needed by issuing minor revisions (for example, Go
1.6.1, Go 1.6.2, and so on).
