## Introduction to Go 1.3 {#introduction}

The latest Go release, version 1.3, arrives six months after 1.2, and
contains no language changes. It focuses primarily on implementation
work, providing precise garbage collection, a major refactoring of the
compiler toolchain that results in faster builds, especially for large
projects, significant performance improvements across the board, and
support for DragonFly BSD, Solaris, Plan 9 and Google's Native Client
architecture (NaCl). It also has an important refinement to the memory
model regarding synchronization. As always, Go 1.3 keeps the [promise of
compatibility](/doc/go1compat.html), and almost everything will continue
to compile and run without change when moved to 1.3.

## Changes to the supported operating systems and architectures {#os}

### Removal of support for Windows 2000 {#win2000}

Microsoft stopped supporting Windows 2000 in 2010. Since it has
[implementation
difficulties](https://codereview.appspot.com/74790043){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} regarding exception handling (signals in Unix
terminology), as of Go 1.3 it is not supported by Go either.

### Support for DragonFly BSD {#dragonfly}

Go 1.3 now includes experimental support for DragonFly BSD on the
`amd64` (64-bit x86) and `386` (32-bit x86) architectures. It uses
DragonFly BSD 3.6 or above.

### Support for FreeBSD {#freebsd}

It was not announced at the time, but since the release of Go 1.2,
support for Go on FreeBSD requires FreeBSD 8 or above.

As of Go 1.3, support for Go on FreeBSD requires that the kernel be
compiled with the `COMPAT_FREEBSD32` flag configured.

In concert with the switch to EABI syscalls for ARM platforms, Go 1.3
will run only on FreeBSD 10. The x86 platforms, 386 and amd64, are
unaffected.

### Support for Native Client {#nacl}

Support for the Native Client virtual machine architecture has returned
to Go with the 1.3 release. It runs on the 32-bit Intel architectures
(`GOARCH=386`) and also on 64-bit Intel, but using 32-bit pointers
(`GOARCH=amd64p32`). There is not yet support for Native Client on ARM.
Note that this is Native Client (NaCl), not Portable Native Client
(PNaCl). Details about Native Client are
[here](https://developers.google.com/native-client/dev/){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"}; how to set up the Go version is described
[here](/wiki/NativeClient).

### Support for NetBSD {#netbsd}

As of Go 1.3, support for Go on NetBSD requires NetBSD 6.0 or above.

### Support for OpenBSD {#openbsd}

As of Go 1.3, support for Go on OpenBSD requires OpenBSD 5.5 or above.

### Support for Plan 9 {#plan9}

Go 1.3 now includes experimental support for Plan 9 on the `386` (32-bit
x86) architecture. It requires the `Tsemacquire` syscall, which has been
in Plan 9 since June, 2012.

### Support for Solaris {#solaris}

Go 1.3 now includes experimental support for Solaris on the `amd64`
(64-bit x86) architecture. It requires illumos, Solaris 11 or above.

## Changes to the memory model {#memory}

The Go 1.3 memory model [adds a new
rule](https://codereview.appspot.com/75130045){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} concerning sending and receiving on buffered channels,
to make explicit that a buffered channel can be used as a simple
semaphore, using a send into the channel to acquire and a receive from
the channel to release. This is not a language change, just a
clarification about an expected property of communication.

## Changes to the implementations and tools {#impl}

### Stack {#stacks}

Go 1.3 has changed the implementation of goroutine stacks away from the
old, "segmented" model to a contiguous model. When a goroutine needs
more stack than is available, its stack is transferred to a larger
single block of memory. The overhead of this transfer operation
amortizes well and eliminates the old "hot spot" problem when a
calculation repeatedly steps across a segment boundary. Details
including performance numbers are in this [design
document](/s/contigstacks).

### Changes to the garbage collector {#garbage_collector}

For a while now, the garbage collector has been *precise* when examining
values in the heap; the Go 1.3 release adds equivalent precision to
values on the stack. This means that a non-pointer Go value such as an
integer will never be mistaken for a pointer and prevent unused memory
from being reclaimed.

Starting with Go 1.3, the runtime assumes that values with pointer type
contain pointers and other values do not. This assumption is fundamental
to the precise behavior of both stack expansion and garbage collection.
Programs that use [package unsafe](/pkg/unsafe/) to store integers in
pointer-typed values are illegal and will crash if the runtime detects
the behavior. Programs that use [package unsafe](/pkg/unsafe/) to store
pointers in integer-typed values are also illegal but more difficult to
diagnose during execution. Because the pointers are hidden from the
runtime, a stack expansion or garbage collection may reclaim the memory
they point at, creating [dangling
pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"}.

*Updating*: Code that uses `unsafe.Pointer` to convert an integer-typed
value held in memory into a pointer is illegal and must be rewritten.
Such code can be identified by `go vet`.

### Map iteration {#map}

Iterations over small maps no longer happen in a consistent order. Go 1
defines that "[The iteration order over maps is not specified and is not
guaranteed to be the same from one iteration to the
next.](/ref/spec#For_statements)" To keep code from depending on map
iteration order, Go 1.0 started each map iteration at a random index in
the map. A new map implementation introduced in Go 1.1 neglected to
randomize iteration for maps with eight or fewer entries, although the
iteration order can still vary from system to system. This has allowed
people to write Go 1.1 and Go 1.2 programs that depend on small map
iteration order and therefore only work reliably on certain systems. Go
1.3 reintroduces random iteration for small maps in order to flush out
these bugs.

*Updating*: If code assumes a fixed iteration order for small maps, it
will break and must be rewritten not to make that assumption. Because
only small maps are affected, the problem arises most often in tests.

### The linker {#liblink}

As part of the general [overhaul](/s/go13linker) to the Go linker, the
compilers and linkers have been refactored. The linker is still a C
program, but now the instruction selection phase that was part of the
linker has been moved to the compiler through the creation of a new
library called `liblink`. By doing instruction selection only once, when
the package is first compiled, this can speed up compilation of large
projects significantly.

*Updating*: Although this is a major internal change, it should have no
effect on programs.

### Status of gccgo {#gccgo}

GCC release 4.9 will contain the Go 1.2 (not 1.3) version of gccgo. The
release schedules for the GCC and Go projects do not coincide, which
means that 1.3 will be available in the development branch but that the
next GCC release, 4.10, will likely have the Go 1.4 version of gccgo.

### Changes to the go command {#gocmd}

The [`cmd/go`](/cmd/go/) command has several new features. The
[`go run`](/cmd/go/) and [`go test`](/cmd/go/) subcommands support a new
`-exec` option to specify an alternate way to run the resulting binary.
Its immediate purpose is to support NaCl.

The test coverage support of the [`go test`](/cmd/go/) subcommand now
automatically sets the coverage mode to `-atomic` when the race detector
is enabled, to eliminate false reports about unsafe access to coverage
counters.

The [`go test`](/cmd/go/) subcommand now always builds the package, even
if it has no test files. Previously, it would do nothing if no test
files were present.

The [`go build`](/cmd/go/) subcommand supports a new `-i` option to
install dependencies of the specified target, but not the target itself.

Cross compiling with [`cgo`](/cmd/cgo/) enabled is now supported. The
CC_FOR_TARGET and CXX_FOR_TARGET environment variables are used when
running all.bash to specify the cross compilers for C and C++ code,
respectively.

Finally, the go command now supports packages that import Objective-C
files (suffixed `.m`) through cgo.

### Changes to cgo {#cgo}

The [`cmd/cgo`](/cmd/cgo/) command, which processes `import "C"`
declarations in Go packages, has corrected a serious bug that may cause
some packages to stop compiling. Previously, all pointers to incomplete
struct types translated to the Go type `*[0]byte`, with the effect that
the Go compiler could not diagnose passing one kind of struct pointer to
a function expecting another. Go 1.3 corrects this mistake by
translating each different incomplete struct to a different named type.

Given the C declaration `typedef struct S T` for an incomplete
`struct S`, some Go code used this bug to refer to the types
`C.struct_S` and `C.T` interchangeably. Cgo now explicitly allows this
use, even for completed struct types. However, some Go code also used
this bug to pass (for example) a `*C.FILE` from one package to another.
This is not legal and no longer works: in general Go packages should
avoid exposing C types and names in their APIs.

*Updating*: Code confusing pointers to incomplete types or passing them
across package boundaries will no longer compile and must be rewritten.
If the conversion is correct and must be preserved, use an explicit
conversion via [`unsafe.Pointer`](/pkg/unsafe/#Pointer).

### SWIG 3.0 required for programs that use SWIG {#swig}

For Go programs that use SWIG, SWIG version 3.0 is now required. The
[`cmd/go`](/cmd/go) command will now link the SWIG generated object
files directly into the binary, rather than building and linking with a
shared library.

### Command-line flag parsing {#gc_flag}

In the gc toolchain, the assemblers now use the same command-line flag
parsing rules as the Go flag package, a departure from the traditional
Unix flag parsing. This may affect scripts that invoke the tool
directly. For example, `go tool 6a -SDfoo` must now be written
`go tool 6a -S -D foo`. (The same change was made to the compilers and
linkers in [Go 1.1](/doc/go1.1#gc_flag).)

### Changes to godoc {#godoc}

When invoked with the `-analysis` flag,
[godoc](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} now performs sophisticated static analysis of the code
it indexes. The results of analysis are presented in both the source
view and the package documentation view, and include the call graph of
each package and the relationships between definitions and references,
types and their methods, interfaces and their implementations, send and
receive operations on channels, functions and their callers, and call
sites and their callees.

### Miscellany {#misc}

The program `misc/benchcmp` that compares performance across
benchmarking runs has been rewritten. Once a shell and awk script in the
main repository, it is now a Go program in the `go.tools` repo.
Documentation is
[here](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/benchcmp){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"}.

For the few of us that build Go distributions, the tool `misc/dist` has
been moved and renamed; it now lives in `misc/makerelease`, still in the
main repository.

## Performance

The performance of Go binaries for this release has improved in many
cases due to changes in the runtime and garbage collection, plus some
changes to libraries. Significant instances include:

- The runtime handles defers more efficiently, reducing the memory
  footprint by about two kilobytes per goroutine that calls defer.
- The garbage collector has been sped up, using a concurrent sweep
  algorithm, better parallelization, and larger pages. The cumulative
  effect can be a 50-70% reduction in collector pause time.
- The race detector (see [this guide](/doc/articles/race_detector.html))
  is now about 40% faster.
- The regular expression package [`regexp`](/pkg/regexp/) is now
  significantly faster for certain simple expressions due to the
  implementation of a second, one-pass execution engine. The choice of
  which engine to use is automatic; the details are hidden from the
  user.

Also, the runtime now includes in stack dumps how long a goroutine has
been blocked, which can be useful information when debugging deadlocks
or performance issues.

## Changes to the standard library {#library}

### New packages {#new_packages}

A new package [`debug/plan9obj`](/pkg/debug/plan9obj/) was added to the
standard library. It implements access to Plan 9
[a.out](https://9p.io/magic/man2html/6/a.out){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} object files.

### Major changes to the library {#major_library_changes}

A previous bug in [`crypto/tls`](/pkg/crypto/tls/) made it possible to
skip verification in TLS inadvertently. In Go 1.3, the bug is fixed: one
must specify either ServerName or InsecureSkipVerify, and if ServerName
is specified it is enforced. This may break existing code that
incorrectly depended on insecure behavior.

There is an important new type added to the standard library:
[`sync.Pool`](/pkg/sync/#Pool). It provides an efficient mechanism for
implementing certain types of caches whose memory can be reclaimed
automatically by the system.

The [`testing`](/pkg/testing/) package's benchmarking helper,
[`B`](/pkg/testing/#B), now has a
[`RunParallel`](/pkg/testing/#B.RunParallel) method to make it easier to
run benchmarks that exercise multiple CPUs.

*Updating*: The crypto/tls fix may break existing code, but such code
was erroneous and should be updated.

### Minor changes to the library {#minor_library_changes}

The following list summarizes a number of minor changes to the library,
mostly additions. See the relevant package documentation for more
information about each change.

- In the [`crypto/tls`](/pkg/crypto/tls/) package, a new
  [`DialWithDialer`](/pkg/crypto/tls/#DialWithDialer) function lets one
  establish a TLS connection using an existing dialer, making it easier
  to control dial options such as timeouts. The package also now reports
  the TLS version used by the connection in the
  [`ConnectionState`](/pkg/crypto/tls/#ConnectionState) struct.
- The [`CreateCertificate`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#CreateCertificate)
  function of the [`crypto/tls`](/pkg/crypto/tls/) package now supports
  parsing (and elsewhere, serialization) of PKCS #10 certificate
  signature requests.
- The formatted print functions of the `fmt` package now define `%F` as
  a synonym for `%f` when printing floating-point values.
- The [`math/big`](/pkg/math/big/) package's [`Int`](/pkg/math/big/#Int)
  and [`Rat`](/pkg/math/big/#Rat) types now implement
  [`encoding.TextMarshaler`](/pkg/encoding/#TextMarshaler) and
  [`encoding.TextUnmarshaler`](/pkg/encoding/#TextUnmarshaler).
- The complex power function, [`Pow`](/pkg/math/cmplx/#Pow), now
  specifies the behavior when the first argument is zero. It was
  undefined before. The details are in the [documentation for the
  function](/pkg/math/cmplx/#Pow).
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package now exposes the properties of
  a TLS connection used to make a client request in the new
  [`Response.TLS`](/pkg/net/http/#Response) field.
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package now allows setting an
  optional server error logger with
  [`Server.ErrorLog`](/pkg/net/http/#Server). The default is still that
  all errors go to stderr.
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package now supports disabling HTTP
  keep-alive connections on the server with
  [`Server.SetKeepAlivesEnabled`](/pkg/net/http/#Server.SetKeepAlivesEnabled).
  The default continues to be that the server does keep-alive (reuses
  connections for multiple requests) by default. Only
  resource-constrained servers or those in the process of graceful
  shutdown will want to disable them.
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package adds an optional
  [`Transport.TLSHandshakeTimeout`](/pkg/net/http/#Transport) setting to
  cap the amount of time HTTP client requests will wait for TLS
  handshakes to complete. It's now also set by default on
  [`DefaultTransport`](/pkg/net/http#DefaultTransport).
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package's
  [`DefaultTransport`](/pkg/net/http/#DefaultTransport), used by the
  HTTP client code, now enables [TCP
  keep-alives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keepalive#TCP_keepalive){rel="noreferrer"
  target="_blank"} by default. Other
  [`Transport`](/pkg/net/http/#Transport) values with a nil `Dial` field
  continue to function the same as before: no TCP keep-alives are used.
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package now enables [TCP
  keep-alives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keepalive#TCP_keepalive){rel="noreferrer"
  target="_blank"} for incoming server requests when
  [`ListenAndServe`](/pkg/net/http/#ListenAndServe) or
  [`ListenAndServeTLS`](/pkg/net/http/#ListenAndServeTLS) are used. When
  a server is started otherwise, TCP keep-alives are not enabled.
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package now provides an optional
  [`Server.ConnState`](/pkg/net/http/#Server) callback to hook various
  phases of a server connection's lifecycle (see
  [`ConnState`](/pkg/net/http/#ConnState)). This can be used to
  implement rate limiting or graceful shutdown.
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package's HTTP client now has an
  optional [`Client.Timeout`](/pkg/net/http/#Client) field to specify an
  end-to-end timeout on requests made using the client.
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package's
  [`Request.ParseMultipartForm`](/pkg/net/http/#Request.ParseMultipartForm)
  method will now return an error if the body's `Content-Type` is not
  `multipart/form-data`. Prior to Go 1.3 it would silently fail and
  return `nil`. Code that relies on the previous behavior should be
  updated.
- In the [`net`](/pkg/net/) package, the [`Dialer`](/pkg/net/#Dialer)
  struct now has a `KeepAlive` option to specify a keep-alive period for
  the connection.
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package's
  [`Transport`](/pkg/net/http/#Transport) now closes
  [`Request.Body`](/pkg/net/http/#Request) consistently, even on error.
- The [`os/exec`](/pkg/os/exec/) package now implements what the
  documentation has always said with regard to relative paths for the
  binary. In particular, it only calls
  [`LookPath`](/pkg/os/exec/#LookPath) when the binary's file name
  contains no path separators.
- The [`SetMapIndex`](/pkg/reflect/#Value.SetMapIndex) function in the
  [`reflect`](/pkg/reflect/) package no longer panics when deleting from
  a `nil` map.
- If the main goroutine calls [`runtime.Goexit`](/pkg/runtime/#Goexit)
  and all other goroutines finish execution, the program now always
  crashes, reporting a detected deadlock. Earlier versions of Go handled
  this situation inconsistently: most instances were reported as
  deadlocks, but some trivial cases exited cleanly instead.
- The runtime/debug package now has a new function
  [`debug.WriteHeapDump`](/pkg/runtime/debug/#WriteHeapDump) that writes
  out a description of the heap.
- The [`CanBackquote`](/pkg/strconv/#CanBackquote) function in the
  [`strconv`](/pkg/strconv/) package now considers the `DEL` character,
  `U+007F`, to be non-printing.
- The [`syscall`](/pkg/syscall/) package now provides
  [`SendmsgN`](/pkg/syscall/#SendmsgN) as an alternate version of
  [`Sendmsg`](/pkg/syscall/#Sendmsg) that returns the number of bytes
  written.
- On Windows, the [`syscall`](/pkg/syscall/) package now supports the
  cdecl calling convention through the addition of a new function
  [`NewCallbackCDecl`](/pkg/syscall/#NewCallbackCDecl) alongside the
  existing function [`NewCallback`](/pkg/syscall/#NewCallback).
- The [`testing`](/pkg/testing/) package now diagnoses tests that call
  `panic(nil)`, which are almost always erroneous. Also, tests now write
  profiles (if invoked with profiling flags) even on failure.
- The [`unicode`](/pkg/unicode/) package and associated support
  throughout the system has been upgraded from Unicode 6.2.0 to [Unicode
  6.3.0](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.3.0/){rel="noreferrer"
  target="_blank"}.
