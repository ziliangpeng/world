## Introduction to Go 1.6 {#introduction}

The latest Go release, version 1.6, arrives six months after 1.5. Most
of its changes are in the implementation of the language, runtime, and
libraries. There are no changes to the language specification. As
always, the release maintains the Go 1 [promise of
compatibility](/doc/go1compat.html). We expect almost all Go programs to
continue to compile and run as before.

The release adds new ports to [Linux on 64-bit MIPS and Android on
32-bit x86](#ports); defined and enforced [rules for sharing Go pointers
with C](#cgo); transparent, automatic [support for HTTP/2](#http2); and
a new mechanism for [template reuse](#template).

## Changes to the language {#language}

There are no language changes in this release.

## Ports

Go 1.6 adds experimental ports to Linux on 64-bit MIPS (`linux/mips64`
and `linux/mips64le`). These ports support `cgo` but only with internal
linking.

Go 1.6 also adds an experimental port to Android on 32-bit x86
(`android/386`).

On FreeBSD, Go 1.6 defaults to using `clang`, not `gcc`, as the external
C compiler.

On Linux on little-endian 64-bit PowerPC (`linux/ppc64le`), Go 1.6 now
supports `cgo` with external linking and is roughly feature complete.

On NaCl, Go 1.5 required SDK version pepper-41. Go 1.6 adds support for
later SDK versions.

On 32-bit x86 systems using the `-dynlink` or `-shared` compilation
modes, the register CX is now overwritten by certain memory references
and should be avoided in hand-written assembly. See the [assembly
documentation](/doc/asm#x86) for details.

## Tools

### Cgo

There is one major change to [`cgo`](/cmd/cgo/), along with one minor
change.

The major change is the definition of rules for sharing Go pointers with
C code, to ensure that such C code can coexist with Go's garbage
collector. Briefly, Go and C may share memory allocated by Go when a
pointer to that memory is passed to C as part of a `cgo` call, provided
that the memory itself contains no pointers to Go-allocated memory, and
provided that C does not retain the pointer after the call returns.
These rules are checked by the runtime during program execution: if the
runtime detects a violation, it prints a diagnosis and crashes the
program. The checks can be disabled by setting the environment variable
`GODEBUG=cgocheck=0`, but note that the vast majority of code identified
by the checks is subtly incompatible with garbage collection in one way
or another. Disabling the checks will typically only lead to more
mysterious failure modes. Fixing the code in question should be strongly
preferred over turning off the checks. See the [`cgo`
documentation](/cmd/cgo/#hdr-Passing_pointers) for more details.

The minor change is the addition of explicit `C.complexfloat` and
`C.complexdouble` types, separate from Go's `complex64` and
`complex128`. Matching the other numeric types, C's complex types and
Go's complex type are no longer interchangeable.

### Compiler Toolchain {#compiler}

The compiler toolchain is mostly unchanged. Internally, the most
significant change is that the parser is now hand-written instead of
generated from [yacc](/cmd/yacc/).

The compiler, linker, and `go` command have a new flag `-msan`,
analogous to `-race` and only available on linux/amd64, that enables
interoperation with the [Clang
MemorySanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"}. Such interoperation is useful mainly for testing a
program containing suspect C or C++ code.

The linker has a new option `-libgcc` to set the expected location of
the C compiler support library when linking [`cgo`](/cmd/cgo/) code. The
option is only consulted when using `-linkmode=internal`, and it may be
set to `none` to disable the use of a support library.

The implementation of [build modes started in Go 1.5](/doc/go1.5#link)
has been expanded to more systems. This release adds support for the
`c-shared` mode on `android/386`, `android/amd64`, `android/arm64`,
`linux/386`, and `linux/arm64`; for the `shared` mode on `linux/386`,
`linux/arm`, `linux/amd64`, and `linux/ppc64le`; and for the new `pie`
mode (generating position-independent executables) on `android/386`,
`android/amd64`, `android/arm`, `android/arm64`, `linux/386`,
`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm`, `linux/arm64`, and `linux/ppc64le`. See the
[design document](/s/execmodes) for details.

As a reminder, the linker's `-X` flag changed in Go 1.5. In Go 1.4 and
earlier, it took two arguments, as in

    -X importpath.name value

Go 1.5 added an alternative syntax using a single argument that is
itself a `name=value` pair:

    -X importpath.name=value

In Go 1.5 the old syntax was still accepted, after printing a warning
suggesting use of the new syntax instead. Go 1.6 continues to accept the
old syntax and print the warning. Go 1.7 will remove support for the old
syntax.

### Gccgo

The release schedules for the GCC and Go projects do not coincide. GCC
release 5 contains the Go 1.4 version of gccgo. The next release, GCC 6,
will have the Go 1.6.1 version of gccgo.

### Go command {#go_command}

The [`go`](/cmd/go) command's basic operation is unchanged, but there
are a number of changes worth noting.

Go 1.5 introduced experimental support for vendoring, enabled by setting
the `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` environment variable to `1`. Go 1.6 keeps the
vendoring support, no longer considered experimental, and enables it by
default. It can be disabled explicitly by setting the
`GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` environment variable to `0`. Go 1.7 will remove
support for the environment variable.

The most likely problem caused by enabling vendoring by default happens
in source trees containing an existing directory named `vendor` that
does not expect to be interpreted according to new vendoring semantics.
In this case, the simplest fix is to rename the directory to anything
other than `vendor` and update any affected import paths.

For details about vendoring, see the documentation for the [`go`
command](/cmd/go/#hdr-Vendor_Directories) and the [design
document](/s/go15vendor).

There is a new build flag, `-msan`, that compiles Go with support for
the LLVM memory sanitizer. This is intended mainly for use when linking
against C or C++ code that is being checked with the memory sanitizer.

### Go doc command {#doc_command}

Go 1.5 introduced the
[`go doc`](/cmd/go/#hdr-Show_documentation_for_package_or_symbol)
command, which allows references to packages using only the package
name, as in `go` `doc` `http`. In the event of ambiguity, the Go 1.5
behavior was to use the package with the lexicographically earliest
import path. In Go 1.6, ambiguity is resolved by preferring import paths
with fewer elements, breaking ties using lexicographic comparison. An
important effect of this change is that original copies of packages are
now preferred over vendored copies. Successful searches also tend to run
faster.

### Go vet command {#vet_command}

The [`go vet`](/cmd/vet) command now diagnoses passing function or
method values as arguments to `Printf`, such as when passing `f` where
`f()` was intended.

## Performance

As always, the changes are so general and varied that precise statements
about performance are difficult to make. Some programs may run faster,
some slower. On average the programs in the Go 1 benchmark suite run a
few percent faster in Go 1.6 than they did in Go 1.5. The garbage
collector's pauses are even lower than in Go 1.5, especially for
programs using a large amount of memory.

There have been significant optimizations bringing more than 10%
improvements to implementations of the
[`compress/bzip2`](/pkg/compress/bzip2/),
[`compress/gzip`](/pkg/compress/gzip/),
[`crypto/aes`](/pkg/crypto/aes/),
[`crypto/elliptic`](/pkg/crypto/elliptic/),
[`crypto/ecdsa`](/pkg/crypto/ecdsa/), and [`sort`](/pkg/sort/) packages.

## Standard library {#library}

### HTTP/2

Go 1.6 adds transparent support in the [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/)
package for the new [HTTP/2
protocol](https://http2.github.io/){rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"}.
Go clients and servers will automatically use HTTP/2 as appropriate when
using HTTPS. There is no exported API specific to details of the HTTP/2
protocol handling, just as there is no exported API specific to
HTTP/1.1.

Programs that must disable HTTP/2 can do so by setting
[`Transport.TLSNextProto`](/pkg/net/http/#Transport) (for clients) or
[`Server.TLSNextProto`](/pkg/net/http/#Server) (for servers) to a
non-nil, empty map.

Programs that must adjust HTTP/2 protocol-specific details can import
and use
[`golang.org/x/net/http2`](https://golang.org/x/net/http2){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"}, in particular its
[ConfigureServer](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/http2/#ConfigureServer){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} and
[ConfigureTransport](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/http2/#ConfigureTransport){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} functions.

### Runtime

The runtime has added lightweight, best-effort detection of concurrent
misuse of maps. As always, if one goroutine is writing to a map, no
other goroutine should be reading or writing the map concurrently. If
the runtime detects this condition, it prints a diagnosis and crashes
the program. The best way to find out more about the problem is to run
the program under the [race detector](/blog/race-detector), which will
more reliably identify the race and give more detail.

For program-ending panics, the runtime now by default prints only the
stack of the running goroutine, not all existing goroutines. Usually
only the current goroutine is relevant to a panic, so omitting the
others significantly reduces irrelevant output in a crash message. To
see the stacks from all goroutines in crash messages, set the
environment variable `GOTRACEBACK` to `all` or call
[`debug.SetTraceback`](/pkg/runtime/debug/#SetTraceback) before the
crash, and rerun the program. See the [runtime
documentation](/pkg/runtime/#hdr-Environment_Variables) for details.

*Updating*: Uncaught panics intended to dump the state of the entire
program, such as when a timeout is detected or when explicitly handling
a received signal, should now call `debug.SetTraceback("all")` before
panicking. Searching for uses of
[`signal.Notify`](/pkg/os/signal/#Notify) may help identify such code.

On Windows, Go programs in Go 1.5 and earlier forced the global Windows
timer resolution to 1ms at startup by calling `timeBeginPeriod(1)`. Go
no longer needs this for good scheduler performance, and changing the
global timer resolution caused problems on some systems, so the call has
been removed.

When using `-buildmode=c-archive` or `-buildmode=c-shared` to build an
archive or a shared library, the handling of signals has changed. In Go
1.5 the archive or shared library would install a signal handler for
most signals. In Go 1.6 it will only install a signal handler for the
synchronous signals needed to handle run-time panics in Go code: SIGBUS,
SIGFPE, SIGSEGV. See the [os/signal](/pkg/os/signal) package for more
details.

### Reflect

The [`reflect`](/pkg/reflect/) package has [resolved a long-standing
incompatibility](/issue/12367) between the gc and gccgo toolchains
regarding embedded unexported struct types containing exported fields.
Code that walks data structures using reflection, especially to
implement serialization in the spirit of the
[`encoding/json`](/pkg/encoding/json/) and
[`encoding/xml`](/pkg/encoding/xml/) packages, may need to be updated.

The problem arises when using reflection to walk through an embedded
unexported struct-typed field into an exported field of that struct. In
this case, `reflect` had incorrectly reported the embedded field as
exported, by returning an empty `Field.PkgPath`. Now it correctly
reports the field as unexported but ignores that fact when evaluating
access to exported fields contained within the struct.

*Updating*: Typically, code that previously walked over structs and used

    f.PkgPath != ""

to exclude inaccessible fields should now use

    f.PkgPath != "" && !f.Anonymous

For example, see the changes to the implementations of
[`encoding/json`](https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/14011/2/src/encoding/json/encode.go){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} and
[`encoding/xml`](https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/14012/2/src/encoding/xml/typeinfo.go){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"}.

### Sorting {#sort}

In the [`sort`](/pkg/sort/) package, the implementation of
[`Sort`](/pkg/sort/#Sort) has been rewritten to make about 10% fewer
calls to the [`Interface`](/pkg/sort/#Interface)'s `Less` and `Swap`
methods, with a corresponding overall time savings. The new algorithm
does choose a different ordering than before for values that compare
equal (those pairs for which `Less(i,` `j)` and `Less(j,` `i)` are
false).

*Updating*: The definition of `Sort` makes no guarantee about the final
order of equal values, but the new behavior may still break programs
that expect a specific order. Such programs should either refine their
`Less` implementations to report the desired order or should switch to
[`Stable`](/pkg/sort/#Stable), which preserves the original input order
of equal values.

### Templates {#template}

In the [text/template](/pkg/text/template/) package, there are two
significant new features to make writing templates easier.

First, it is now possible to [trim spaces around template
actions](/pkg/text/template/#hdr-Text_and_spaces), which can make
template definitions more readable. A minus sign at the beginning of an
action says to trim space before the action, and a minus sign at the end
of an action says to trim space after the action. For example, the
template

    {{23 -}}
       <
    {{- 45}}

formats as `23<45`.

Second, the new [`{{block}}` action](/pkg/text/template/#hdr-Actions),
combined with allowing redefinition of named templates, provides a
simple way to define pieces of a template that can be replaced in
different instantiations. There is [an
example](/pkg/text/template/#example_Template_block) in the
`text/template` package that demonstrates this new feature.

### Minor changes to the library {#minor_library_changes}

- The [`archive/tar`](/pkg/archive/tar/) package's implementation
  corrects many bugs in rare corner cases of the file format. One
  visible change is that the [`Reader`](/pkg/archive/tar/#Reader) type's
  [`Read`](/pkg/archive/tar/#Reader.Read) method now presents the
  content of special file types as being empty, returning `io.EOF`
  immediately.
- In the [`archive/zip`](/pkg/archive/zip/) package, the
  [`Reader`](/pkg/archive/zip/#Reader) type now has a
  [`RegisterDecompressor`](/pkg/archive/zip/#Reader.RegisterDecompressor)
  method, and the [`Writer`](/pkg/archive/zip/#Writer) type now has a
  [`RegisterCompressor`](/pkg/archive/zip/#Writer.RegisterCompressor)
  method, enabling control over compression options for individual zip
  files. These take precedence over the pre-existing global
  [`RegisterDecompressor`](/pkg/archive/zip/#RegisterDecompressor) and
  [`RegisterCompressor`](/pkg/archive/zip/#RegisterCompressor)
  functions.
- The [`bufio`](/pkg/bufio/) package's [`Scanner`](/pkg/bufio/#Scanner)
  type now has a [`Buffer`](/pkg/bufio/#Scanner.Buffer) method, to
  specify an initial buffer and maximum buffer size to use during
  scanning. This makes it possible, when needed, to scan tokens larger
  than `MaxScanTokenSize`. Also for the `Scanner`, the package now
  defines the [`ErrFinalToken`](/pkg/bufio/#ErrFinalToken) error value,
  for use by [split functions](/pkg/bufio/#SplitFunc) to abort
  processing or to return a final empty token.
- The [`compress/flate`](/pkg/compress/flate/) package has deprecated
  its [`ReadError`](/pkg/compress/flate/#ReadError) and
  [`WriteError`](/pkg/compress/flate/#WriteError) error implementations.
  In Go 1.5 they were only rarely returned when an error was
  encountered; now they are never returned, although they remain defined
  for compatibility.
- The [`compress/flate`](/pkg/compress/flate/),
  [`compress/gzip`](/pkg/compress/gzip/), and
  [`compress/zlib`](/pkg/compress/zlib/) packages now report
  [`io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`](/pkg/io/#ErrUnexpectedEOF) for truncated input
  streams, instead of [`io.EOF`](/pkg/io/#EOF).
- The [`crypto/cipher`](/pkg/crypto/cipher/) package now overwrites the
  destination buffer in the event of a GCM decryption failure. This is
  to allow the AESNI code to avoid using a temporary buffer.
- The [`crypto/tls`](/pkg/crypto/tls/) package has a variety of minor
  changes. It now allows [`Listen`](/pkg/crypto/tls/#Listen) to succeed
  when the [`Config`](/pkg/crypto/tls/#Config) has a nil `Certificates`,
  as long as the `GetCertificate` callback is set, it adds support for
  RSA with AES-GCM cipher suites, and it adds a
  [`RecordHeaderError`](/pkg/crypto/tls/#RecordHeaderError) to allow
  clients (in particular, the [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package) to
  report a better error when attempting a TLS connection to a non-TLS
  server.
- The [`crypto/x509`](/pkg/crypto/x509/) package now permits
  certificates to contain negative serial numbers (technically an error,
  but unfortunately common in practice), and it defines a new
  [`InsecureAlgorithmError`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#InsecureAlgorithmError)
  to give a better error message when rejecting a certificate signed
  with an insecure algorithm like MD5.
- The [`debug/dwarf`](/pkg/debug/dwarf) and
  [`debug/elf`](/pkg/debug/elf/) packages together add support for
  compressed DWARF sections. User code needs no updating: the sections
  are decompressed automatically when read.
- The [`debug/elf`](/pkg/debug/elf/) package adds support for general
  compressed ELF sections. User code needs no updating: the sections are
  decompressed automatically when read. However, compressed
  [`Sections`](/pkg/debug/elf/#Section) do not support random access:
  they have a nil `ReaderAt` field.
- The [`encoding/asn1`](/pkg/encoding/asn1/) package now exports [tag
  and class constants](/pkg/encoding/asn1/#pkg-constants) useful for
  advanced parsing of ASN.1 structures.
- Also in the [`encoding/asn1`](/pkg/encoding/asn1/) package,
  [`Unmarshal`](/pkg/encoding/asn1/#Unmarshal) now rejects various
  non-standard integer and length encodings.
- The [`encoding/base64`](/pkg/encoding/base64) package's
  [`Decoder`](/pkg/encoding/base64/#Decoder) has been fixed to process
  the final bytes of its input. Previously it processed as many
  four-byte tokens as possible but ignored the remainder, up to three
  bytes. The `Decoder` therefore now handles inputs in unpadded
  encodings (like
  [RawURLEncoding](/pkg/encoding/base64/#RawURLEncoding)) correctly, but
  it also rejects inputs in padded encodings that are truncated or end
  with invalid bytes, such as trailing spaces.
- The [`encoding/json`](/pkg/encoding/json/) package now checks the
  syntax of a [`Number`](/pkg/encoding/json/#Number) before marshaling
  it, requiring that it conforms to the JSON specification for numeric
  values. As in previous releases, the zero `Number` (an empty string)
  is marshaled as a literal 0 (zero).
- The [`encoding/xml`](/pkg/encoding/xml/) package's
  [`Marshal`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Marshal) function now supports a
  `cdata` attribute, such as `chardata` but encoding its argument in one
  or more `<![CDATA[ ... ]]>` tags.
- Also in the [`encoding/xml`](/pkg/encoding/xml/) package,
  [`Decoder`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Decoder)'s
  [`Token`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Decoder.Token) method now reports an
  error when encountering EOF before seeing all open tags closed,
  consistent with its general requirement that tags in the input be
  properly matched. To avoid that requirement, use
  [`RawToken`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Decoder.RawToken).
- The [`fmt`](/pkg/fmt/) package now allows any integer type as an
  argument to [`Printf`](/pkg/fmt/#Printf)'s `*` width and precision
  specification. In previous releases, the argument to `*` was required
  to have type `int`.
- Also in the [`fmt`](/pkg/fmt/) package, [`Scanf`](/pkg/fmt/#Scanf) can
  now scan hexadecimal strings using %X, as an alias for %x. Both
  formats accept any mix of upper- and lower-case hexadecimal.
- The [`image`](/pkg/image/) and [`image/color`](/pkg/image/color/)
  packages add [`NYCbCrA`](/pkg/image/#NYCbCrA) and
  [`NYCbCrA`](/pkg/image/color/#NYCbCrA) types, to support Y'CbCr images
  with non-premultiplied alpha.
- The [`io`](/pkg/io/) package's [`MultiWriter`](/pkg/io/#MultiWriter)
  implementation now implements a `WriteString` method, for use by
  [`WriteString`](/pkg/io/#WriteString).
- In the [`math/big`](/pkg/math/big/) package,
  [`Int`](/pkg/math/big/#Int) adds [`Append`](/pkg/math/big/#Int.Append)
  and [`Text`](/pkg/math/big/#Int.Text) methods to give more control
  over printing.
- Also in the [`math/big`](/pkg/math/big/) package,
  [`Float`](/pkg/math/big/#Float) now implements
  [`encoding.TextMarshaler`](/pkg/encoding/#TextMarshaler) and
  [`encoding.TextUnmarshaler`](/pkg/encoding/#TextUnmarshaler), allowing
  it to be serialized in a natural form by the
  [`encoding/json`](/pkg/encoding/json/) and
  [`encoding/xml`](/pkg/encoding/xml/) packages.
- Also in the [`math/big`](/pkg/math/big/) package,
  [`Float`](/pkg/math/big/#Float)'s
  [`Append`](/pkg/math/big/#Float.Append) method now supports the
  special precision argument -1. As in
  [`strconv.ParseFloat`](/pkg/strconv/#ParseFloat), precision -1 means
  to use the smallest number of digits necessary such that
  [`Parse`](/pkg/math/big/#Float.Parse) reading the result into a
  `Float` of the same precision will yield the original value.
- The [`math/rand`](/pkg/math/rand/) package adds a
  [`Read`](/pkg/math/rand/#Read) function, and likewise
  [`Rand`](/pkg/math/rand/#Rand) adds a
  [`Read`](/pkg/math/rand/#Rand.Read) method. These make it easier to
  generate pseudorandom test data. Note that, like the rest of the
  package, these should not be used in cryptographic settings; for such
  purposes, use the [`crypto/rand`](/pkg/crypto/rand/) package instead.
- The [`net`](/pkg/net/) package's [`ParseMAC`](/pkg/net/#ParseMAC)
  function now accepts 20-byte IP-over-InfiniBand (IPoIB) link-layer
  addresses.
- Also in the [`net`](/pkg/net/) package, there have been a few changes
  to DNS lookups. First, the [`DNSError`](/pkg/net/#DNSError) error
  implementation now implements [`Error`](/pkg/net/#Error), and in
  particular its new [`IsTemporary`](/pkg/net/#DNSError.IsTemporary)
  method returns true for DNS server errors. Second, DNS lookup
  functions such as [`LookupAddr`](/pkg/net/#LookupAddr) now return
  rooted domain names (with a trailing dot) on Plan 9 and Windows, to
  match the behavior of Go on Unix systems.
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package has a number of minor
  additions beyond the HTTP/2 support already discussed. First, the
  [`FileServer`](/pkg/net/http/#FileServer) now sorts its generated
  directory listings by file name. Second, the
  [`ServeFile`](/pkg/net/http/#ServeFile) function now refuses to serve
  a result if the request's URL path contains ".." (dot-dot) as a path
  element. Programs should typically use `FileServer` and
  [`Dir`](/pkg/net/http/#Dir) instead of calling `ServeFile` directly.
  Programs that need to serve file content in response to requests for
  URLs containing dot-dot can still call
  [`ServeContent`](/pkg/net/http/#ServeContent). Third, the
  [`Client`](/pkg/net/http/#Client) now allows user code to set the
  `Expect:` `100-continue` header (see
  [`Transport.ExpectContinueTimeout`](/pkg/net/http/#Transport)).
  Fourth, there are [five new error
  codes](/pkg/net/http/#pkg-constants): `StatusPreconditionRequired`
  (428), `StatusTooManyRequests` (429),
  `StatusRequestHeaderFieldsTooLarge` (431), and
  `StatusNetworkAuthenticationRequired` (511) from RFC 6585, as well as
  the recently-approved `StatusUnavailableForLegalReasons` (451). Fifth,
  the implementation and documentation of
  [`CloseNotifier`](/pkg/net/http/#CloseNotifier) has been substantially
  changed. The [`Hijacker`](/pkg/net/http/#Hijacker) interface now works
  correctly on connections that have previously been used with
  `CloseNotifier`. The documentation now describes when `CloseNotifier`
  is expected to work.
- Also in the [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package, there are a few
  changes related to the handling of a
  [`Request`](/pkg/net/http/#Request) data structure with its `Method`
  field set to the empty string. An empty `Method` field has always been
  documented as an alias for `"GET"` and it remains so. However, Go 1.6
  fixes a few routines that did not treat an empty `Method` the same as
  an explicit `"GET"`. Most notably, in previous releases
  [`Client`](/pkg/net/http/#Client) followed redirects only with
  `Method` set explicitly to `"GET"`; in Go 1.6 `Client` also follows
  redirects for the empty `Method`. Finally,
  [`NewRequest`](/pkg/net/http/#NewRequest) accepts a `method` argument
  that has not been documented as allowed to be empty. In past releases,
  passing an empty `method` argument resulted in a `Request` with an
  empty `Method` field. In Go 1.6, the resulting `Request` always has an
  initialized `Method` field: if its argument is an empty string,
  `NewRequest` sets the `Method` field in the returned `Request` to
  `"GET"`.
- The [`net/http/httptest`](/pkg/net/http/httptest/) package's
  [`ResponseRecorder`](/pkg/net/http/httptest/#ResponseRecorder) now
  initializes a default Content-Type header using the same
  content-sniffing algorithm as in
  [`http.Server`](/pkg/net/http/#Server).
- The [`net/url`](/pkg/net/url/) package's
  [`Parse`](/pkg/net/url/#Parse) is now stricter and more spec-compliant
  regarding the parsing of host names. For example, spaces in the host
  name are no longer accepted.
- Also in the [`net/url`](/pkg/net/url/) package, the
  [`Error`](/pkg/net/url/#Error) type now implements
  [`net.Error`](/pkg/net/#Error).
- The [`os`](/pkg/os/) package's [`IsExist`](/pkg/os/#IsExist),
  [`IsNotExist`](/pkg/os/#IsNotExist), and
  [`IsPermission`](/pkg/os/#IsPermission) now return correct results
  when inquiring about an [`SyscallError`](/pkg/os/#SyscallError).
- On Unix-like systems, when a write to [`os.Stdout` or
  `os.Stderr`](/pkg/os/#pkg-variables) (more precisely, an `os.File`
  opened for file descriptor 1 or 2) fails due to a broken pipe error,
  the program will raise a `SIGPIPE` signal. By default this will cause
  the program to exit; this may be changed by calling the
  [`os/signal`](/pkg/os/signal) [`Notify`](/pkg/os/signal/#Notify)
  function for `syscall.SIGPIPE`. A write to a broken pipe on a file
  descriptor other 1 or 2 will simply return `syscall.EPIPE` (possibly
  wrapped in [`os.PathError`](/pkg/os#PathError) and/or
  [`os.SyscallError`](/pkg/os#SyscallError)) to the caller. The old
  behavior of raising an uncatchable `SIGPIPE` signal after 10
  consecutive writes to a broken pipe no longer occurs.
- In the [`os/exec`](/pkg/os/exec/) package,
  [`Cmd`](/pkg/os/exec/#Cmd)'s [`Output`](/pkg/os/exec/#Cmd.Output)
  method continues to return an [`ExitError`](/pkg/os/exec/#ExitError)
  when a command exits with an unsuccessful status. If standard error
  would otherwise have been discarded, the returned `ExitError` now
  holds a prefix and suffix (currently 32 kB) of the failed command's
  standard error output, for debugging or for inclusion in error
  messages. The `ExitError`'s [`String`](/pkg/os/exec/#ExitError.String)
  method does not show the captured standard error; programs must
  retrieve it from the data structure separately.
- On Windows, the [`path/filepath`](/pkg/path/filepath/) package's
  [`Join`](/pkg/path/filepath/#Join) function now correctly handles the
  case when the base is a relative drive path. For example,
  `` Join(`c:`, `` `` `a`) `` now returns `` `c:a` `` instead of
  `` `c:\a` `` as in past releases. This may affect code that expects
  the incorrect result.
- In the [`regexp`](/pkg/regexp/) package, the
  [`Regexp`](/pkg/regexp/#Regexp) type has always been safe for use by
  concurrent goroutines. It uses a [`sync.Mutex`](/pkg/sync/#Mutex) to
  protect a cache of scratch spaces used during regular expression
  searches. Some high-concurrency servers using the same `Regexp` from
  many goroutines have seen degraded performance due to contention on
  that mutex. To help such servers, `Regexp` now has a
  [`Copy`](/pkg/regexp/#Regexp.Copy) method, which makes a copy of a
  `Regexp` that shares most of the structure of the original but has its
  own scratch space cache. Two goroutines can use different copies of a
  `Regexp` without mutex contention. A copy does have additional space
  overhead, so `Copy` should only be used when contention has been
  observed.
- The [`strconv`](/pkg/strconv/) package adds
  [`IsGraphic`](/pkg/strconv/#IsGraphic), similar to
  [`IsPrint`](/pkg/strconv/#IsPrint). It also adds
  [`QuoteToGraphic`](/pkg/strconv/#QuoteToGraphic),
  [`QuoteRuneToGraphic`](/pkg/strconv/#QuoteRuneToGraphic),
  [`AppendQuoteToGraphic`](/pkg/strconv/#AppendQuoteToGraphic), and
  [`AppendQuoteRuneToGraphic`](/pkg/strconv/#AppendQuoteRuneToGraphic),
  analogous to [`QuoteToASCII`](/pkg/strconv/#QuoteToASCII),
  [`QuoteRuneToASCII`](/pkg/strconv/#QuoteRuneToASCII), and so on. The
  `ASCII` family escapes all space characters except ASCII space
  (U+0020). In contrast, the `Graphic` family does not escape any
  Unicode space characters (category Zs).
- In the [`testing`](/pkg/testing/) package, when a test calls
  [t.Parallel](/pkg/testing/#T.Parallel), that test is paused until all
  non-parallel tests complete, and then that test continues execution
  with all other parallel tests. Go 1.6 changes the time reported for
  such a test: previously the time counted only the parallel execution,
  but now it also counts the time from the start of testing until the
  call to `t.Parallel`.
- The [`text/template`](/pkg/text/template/) package contains two minor
  changes, in addition to the [major changes](#template) described
  above. First, it adds a new
  [`ExecError`](/pkg/text/template/#ExecError) type returned for any
  error during [`Execute`](/pkg/text/template/#Template.Execute) that
  does not originate in a `Write` to the underlying writer. Callers can
  distinguish template usage errors from I/O errors by checking for
  `ExecError`. Second, the [`Funcs`](/pkg/text/template/#Template.Funcs)
  method now checks that the names used as keys in the
  [`FuncMap`](/pkg/text/template/#FuncMap) are identifiers that can
  appear in a template function invocation. If not, `Funcs` panics.
- The [`time`](/pkg/time/) package's [`Parse`](/pkg/time/#Parse)
  function has always rejected any day of month larger than 31, such as
  January 32. In Go 1.6, `Parse` now also rejects February 29 in
  non-leap years, February 30, February 31, April 31, June 31, September
  31, and November 31.
