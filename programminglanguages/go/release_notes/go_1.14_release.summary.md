### Summary of Go 1.14

Go 1.14 declared Go modules ready for production, introduced asynchronous preemption for goroutines, and dramatically improved the performance of `defer`.

**Language Features & Syntax**
*   Interfaces can now embed other interfaces with overlapping method sets (methods with identical names and signatures).

**Performance Improvements**
*   The performance of `defer` was significantly improved, making its overhead "almost zero" in most cases.
*   **Asynchronous preemption** was added to the runtime, allowing goroutines in tight loops without function calls to be preempted. This prevents them from freezing the scheduler or delaying garbage collection.
*   Unlocking highly contended `sync.Mutex`es is now faster on multi-CPU machines.

**Tooling & Developer Experience**
*   **Go modules are now production-ready**, and all users are encouraged to migrate.
*   When a `vendor` directory is present, the `go` command now defaults to using it for builds (`-mod=vendor`).
*   `go test -v` now **streams `t.Log` output immediately**, making it much easier to monitor the progress of long-running tests.

**Major Library Updates**
*   The `testing` package added a **`T.Cleanup` function**, which registers a function to be called when a test completes, simplifying test teardown logic.
*   A new `hash/maphash` package was added to provide high-quality, randomized hash functions for use in hash tables.
*   Support for the insecure and obsolete SSLv3 protocol was completely removed from the `crypto/tls` package.
