### Summary of Go 1.10

Go 1.10 introduced a build cache and a test cache, leading to significantly faster builds and test runs for day-to-day development. It also added a new, more efficient `strings.Builder` type.

**Language Features & Syntax**
*   There were no significant changes to the language in this release.

**Performance Improvements**
*   The `go` command now maintains a **build cache** of recently compiled packages, significantly speeding up build times. The `go build -i` flag is no longer necessary for performance.
*   The compiler includes many improvements to the performance of generated code.

**Tooling & Developer Experience**
*   `go test` now **caches successful test results**. If a test is run again without any changes to the test or the code it depends on, the cached result is displayed instantly.
*   `go test` now automatically runs a subset of `go vet` checks before executing tests, catching errors earlier in the development cycle.
*   A new `go test -json` flag provides machine-readable JSON output for test results, enabling better IDE and tooling integration.
*   The `go` tool can now deduce the `GOROOT` from its own location, making Go binary distributions more portable.

**Major Library Updates**
*   A new `strings.Builder` type was added, providing a more efficient way to construct strings incrementally compared to `bytes.Buffer`.
*   `cgo` now allows C code to directly access Go string contents via the `_GoString_` type, simplifying string passing.
*   The `database/sql/driver` interfaces were updated to give driver authors more control over connection management and features.
