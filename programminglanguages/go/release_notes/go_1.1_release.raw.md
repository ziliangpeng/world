## Introduction to Go 1.1 {#introduction}

THE RELEASE of [Go version 1](/doc/go1.html) (Go 1 or Go 1.0 for short)
in March of 2012 introduced a new period of stability in the Go language
and libraries. That stability has helped nourish a growing community of
Go users and systems around the world. Several "point" releases since
then---1.0.1, 1.0.2, and 1.0.3---have been issued. These point releases
fixed known bugs but made no non-critical changes to the implementation.

This new release, Go 1.1, keeps the [promise of
compatibility](/doc/go1compat.html) but adds a couple of significant
(backwards-compatible, of course) language changes, has a long list of
(again, compatible) library changes, and includes major work on the
implementation of the compilers, libraries, and run-time. The focus is
on performance. Benchmarking is an inexact science at best, but we see
significant, sometimes dramatic speedups for many of our test programs.
We trust that many of our users' programs will also see improvements
just by updating their Go installation and recompiling.

This document summarizes the changes between Go 1 and Go 1.1. Very
little if any code will need modification to run with Go 1.1, although a
couple of rare error cases surface with this release and need to be
addressed if they arise. Details appear below; see the discussion of
[64-bit ints](#int) and [Unicode literals](#unicode_literals) in
particular.

## Changes to the language {#language}

[The Go compatibility document](/doc/go1compat.html) promises that
programs written to the Go 1 language specification will continue to
operate, and those promises are maintained. In the interest of firming
up the specification, though, there are details about some error cases
that have been clarified. There are also some new language features.

### Integer division by zero {#divzero}

In Go 1, integer division by a constant zero produced a run-time panic:

    func f(x int) int {
        return x/0
    }

In Go 1.1, an integer division by constant zero is not a legal program,
so it is a compile-time error.

### Surrogates in Unicode literals {#unicode_literals}

The definition of string and rune literals has been refined to exclude
surrogate halves from the set of valid Unicode code points. See the
[Unicode](#unicode) section for more information.

### Method values {#method_values}

Go 1.1 now implements [method values](/ref/spec#Method_values), which
are functions that have been bound to a specific receiver value. For
instance, given a [`Writer`](/pkg/bufio/#Writer) value `w`, the
expression `w.Write`, a method value, is a function that will always
write to `w`; it is equivalent to a function literal closing over `w`:

    func (p []byte) (n int, err error) {
        return w.Write(p)
    }

Method values are distinct from method expressions, which generate
functions from methods of a given type; the method expression
`(*bufio.Writer).Write` is equivalent to a function with an extra first
argument, a receiver of type `(*bufio.Writer)`:

    func (w *bufio.Writer, p []byte) (n int, err error) {
        return w.Write(p)
    }

*Updating*: No existing code is affected; the change is strictly
backward-compatible.

### Return requirements {#return}

Before Go 1.1, a function that returned a value needed an explicit
"return" or call to `panic` at the end of the function; this was a
simple way to make the programmer be explicit about the meaning of the
function. But there are many cases where a final "return" is clearly
unnecessary, such as a function with only an infinite "for" loop.

In Go 1.1, the rule about final "return" statements is more permissive.
It introduces the concept of a [*terminating
statement*](/ref/spec#Terminating_statements), a statement that is
guaranteed to be the last one a function executes. Examples include
"for" loops with no condition and "if-else" statements in which each
half ends in a "return". If the final statement of a function can be
shown *syntactically* to be a terminating statement, no final "return"
statement is needed.

Note that the rule is purely syntactic: it pays no attention to the
values in the code and therefore requires no complex analysis.

*Updating*: The change is backward-compatible, but existing code with
superfluous "return" statements and calls to `panic` may be simplified
manually. Such code can be identified by `go vet`.

## Changes to the implementations and tools {#impl}

### Status of gccgo {#gccgo}

The GCC release schedule does not coincide with the Go release schedule,
so some skew is inevitable in `gccgo`'s releases. The 4.8.0 version of
GCC shipped in March, 2013 and includes a nearly-Go 1.1 version of
`gccgo`. Its library is a little behind the release, but the biggest
difference is that method values are not implemented. Sometime around
July 2013, we expect 4.8.2 of GCC to ship with a `gccgo` providing a
complete Go 1.1 implementation.

### Command-line flag parsing {#gc_flag}

In the gc toolchain, the compilers and linkers now use the same
command-line flag parsing rules as the Go flag package, a departure from
the traditional Unix flag parsing. This may affect scripts that invoke
the tool directly. For example, `go tool 6c -Fw -Dfoo` must now be
written `go tool 6c -F -w -D foo`.

### Size of int on 64-bit platforms {#int}

The language allows the implementation to choose whether the `int` type
and `uint` types are 32 or 64 bits. Previous Go implementations made
`int` and `uint` 32 bits on all systems. Both the gc and gccgo
implementations now make `int` and `uint` 64 bits on 64-bit platforms
such as AMD64/x86-64. Among other things, this enables the allocation of
slices with more than 2 billion elements on 64-bit platforms.

*Updating*: Most programs will be unaffected by this change. Because Go
does not allow implicit conversions between distinct [numeric
types](/ref/spec#Numeric_types), no programs will stop compiling due to
this change. However, programs that contain implicit assumptions that
`int` is only 32 bits may change behavior. For example, this code prints
a positive number on 64-bit systems and a negative one on 32-bit
systems:

    x := ^uint32(0) // x is 0xffffffff
    i := int(x)     // i is -1 on 32-bit systems, 0xffffffff on 64-bit
    fmt.Println(i)

Portable code intending 32-bit sign extension (yielding `-1` on all
systems) would instead say:

    i := int(int32(x))

### Heap size on 64-bit architectures {#heap}

On 64-bit architectures, the maximum heap size has been enlarged
substantially, from a few gigabytes to several tens of gigabytes. (The
exact details depend on the system and may change.)

On 32-bit architectures, the heap size has not changed.

*Updating*: This change should have no effect on existing programs
beyond allowing them to run with larger heaps.

### Unicode

To make it possible to represent code points greater than 65535 in
UTF-16, Unicode defines *surrogate halves*, a range of code points to be
used only in the assembly of large values, and only in UTF-16. The code
points in that surrogate range are illegal for any other purpose. In Go
1.1, this constraint is honored by the compiler, libraries, and
run-time: a surrogate half is illegal as a rune value, when encoded as
UTF-8, or when encoded in isolation as UTF-16. When encountered, for
example in converting from a rune to UTF-8, it is treated as an encoding
error and will yield the replacement rune,
[`utf8.RuneError`](/pkg/unicode/utf8/#RuneError), U+FFFD.

This program,

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        fmt.Printf("%+q\n", string(0xD800))
    }

printed `"\ud800"` in Go 1.0, but prints `"\ufffd"` in Go 1.1.

Surrogate-half Unicode values are now illegal in rune and string
constants, so constants such as `'\ud800'` and `"\ud800"` are now
rejected by the compilers. When written explicitly as UTF-8 encoded
bytes, such strings can still be created, as in `"\xed\xa0\x80"`.
However, when such a string is decoded as a sequence of runes, as in a
range loop, it will yield only `utf8.RuneError` values.

The Unicode byte order mark U+FEFF, encoded in UTF-8, is now permitted
as the first character of a Go source file. Even though its appearance
in the byte-order-free UTF-8 encoding is clearly unnecessary, some
editors add the mark as a kind of "magic number" identifying a UTF-8
encoded file.

*Updating*: Most programs will be unaffected by the surrogate change.
Programs that depend on the old behavior should be modified to avoid the
issue. The byte-order-mark change is strictly backward-compatible.

### Race detector {#race}

A major addition to the tools is a *race detector*, a way to find bugs
in programs caused by concurrent access of the same variable, where at
least one of the accesses is a write. This new facility is built into
the `go` tool. For now, it is only available on Linux, Mac OS X, and
Windows systems with 64-bit x86 processors. To enable it, set the
`-race` flag when building or testing your program (for instance,
`go test -race`). The race detector is documented in [a separate
article](/doc/articles/race_detector.html).

### The gc assemblers {#gc_asm}

Due to the change of the [`int`](#int) to 64 bits and a new internal
[representation of functions](/s/go11func), the arrangement of function
arguments on the stack has changed in the gc toolchain. Functions
written in assembly will need to be revised at least to adjust frame
pointer offsets.

*Updating*: The `go vet` command now checks that functions implemented
in assembly match the Go function prototypes they implement.

### Changes to the go command {#gocmd}

The [`go`](/cmd/go/) command has acquired several changes intended to
improve the experience for new Go users.

First, when compiling, testing, or running Go code, the `go` command
will now give more detailed error messages, including a list of paths
searched, when a package cannot be located.

    $ go build foo/quxx
    can't load package: package foo/quxx: cannot find package "foo/quxx" in any of:
            /home/you/go/src/pkg/foo/quxx (from $GOROOT)
            /home/you/src/foo/quxx (from $GOPATH)

Second, the `go get` command no longer allows `$GOROOT` as the default
destination when downloading package source. To use the `go get`
command, a [valid `$GOPATH`](/doc/code.html#GOPATH) is now required.

    $ GOPATH= go get code.google.com/p/foo/quxx
    package code.google.com/p/foo/quxx: cannot download, $GOPATH not set. For more details see: go help gopath

Finally, as a result of the previous change, the `go get` command will
also fail when `$GOPATH` and `$GOROOT` are set to the same value.

    $ GOPATH=$GOROOT go get code.google.com/p/foo/quxx
    warning: GOPATH set to GOROOT (/home/you/go) has no effect
    package code.google.com/p/foo/quxx: cannot download, $GOPATH must not be set to $GOROOT. For more details see: go help gopath

### Changes to the go test command {#gotest}

The [`go test`](/cmd/go/#hdr-Test_packages) command no longer deletes
the binary when run with profiling enabled, to make it easier to analyze
the profile. The implementation sets the `-c` flag automatically, so
after running,

    $ go test -cpuprofile cpuprof.out mypackage

the file `mypackage.test` will be left in the directory where `go test`
was run.

The [`go test`](/cmd/go/#hdr-Test_packages) command can now generate
profiling information that reports where goroutines are blocked, that
is, where they tend to stall waiting for an event such as a channel
communication. The information is presented as a *blocking profile*
enabled with the `-blockprofile` option of `go test`. Run `go help test`
for more information.

### Changes to the go fix command {#gofix}

The [`fix`](/cmd/fix/) command, usually run as `go fix`, no longer
applies fixes to update code from before Go 1 to use Go 1 APIs. To
update pre-Go 1 code to Go 1.1, use a Go 1.0 toolchain to convert the
code to Go 1.0 first.

### Build constraints {#tags}

The "`go1.1`" tag has been added to the list of default [build
constraints](/pkg/go/build/#hdr-Build_Constraints). This permits
packages to take advantage of the new features in Go 1.1 while remaining
compatible with earlier versions of Go.

To build a file only with Go 1.1 and above, add this build constraint:

    // +build go1.1

To build a file only with Go 1.0.x, use the converse constraint:

    // +build !go1.1

### Additional platforms {#platforms}

The Go 1.1 toolchain adds experimental support for `freebsd/arm`,
`netbsd/386`, `netbsd/amd64`, `netbsd/arm`, `openbsd/386` and
`openbsd/amd64` platforms.

An ARMv6 or later processor is required for `freebsd/arm` or
`netbsd/arm`.

Go 1.1 adds experimental support for `cgo` on `linux/arm`.

### Cross compilation {#crosscompile}

When cross-compiling, the `go` tool will disable `cgo` support by
default.

To explicitly enable `cgo`, set `CGO_ENABLED=1`.

## Performance

The performance of code compiled with the Go 1.1 gc tool suite should be
noticeably better for most Go programs. Typical improvements relative to
Go 1.0 seem to be about 30%-40%, sometimes much more, but occasionally
less or even non-existent. There are too many small performance-driven
tweaks through the tools and libraries to list them all here, but the
following major changes are worth noting:

- The gc compilers generate better code in many cases, most noticeably
  for floating point on the 32-bit Intel architecture.
- The gc compilers do more in-lining, including for some operations in
  the run-time such as [`append`](/pkg/builtin/#append) and interface
  conversions.
- There is a new implementation of Go maps with significant reduction in
  memory footprint and CPU time.
- The garbage collector has been made more parallel, which can reduce
  latencies for programs running on multiple CPUs.
- The garbage collector is also more precise, which costs a small amount
  of CPU time but can reduce the size of the heap significantly,
  especially on 32-bit architectures.
- Due to tighter coupling of the run-time and network libraries, fewer
  context switches are required on network operations.

## Changes to the standard library {#library}

### bufio.Scanner {#bufio_scanner}

The various routines to scan textual input in the [`bufio`](/pkg/bufio/)
package, [`ReadBytes`](/pkg/bufio/#Reader.ReadBytes),
[`ReadString`](/pkg/bufio/#Reader.ReadString) and particularly
[`ReadLine`](/pkg/bufio/#Reader.ReadLine), are needlessly complex to use
for simple purposes. In Go 1.1, a new type,
[`Scanner`](/pkg/bufio/#Scanner), has been added to make it easier to do
simple tasks such as read the input as a sequence of lines or
space-delimited words. It simplifies the problem by terminating the scan
on problematic input such as pathologically long lines, and having a
simple default: line-oriented input, with each line stripped of its
terminator. Here is code to reproduce the input a line at a time:

    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
    for scanner.Scan() {
        fmt.Println(scanner.Text()) // Println will add back the final '\n'
    }
    if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "reading standard input:", err)
    }

Scanning behavior can be adjusted through a function to control
subdividing the input (see the documentation for
[`SplitFunc`](/pkg/bufio/#SplitFunc)), but for tough problems or the
need to continue past errors, the older interface may still be required.

### net

The protocol-specific resolvers in the [`net`](/pkg/net/) package were
formerly lax about the network name passed in. Although the
documentation was clear that the only valid networks for
[`ResolveTCPAddr`](/pkg/net/#ResolveTCPAddr) are `"tcp"`, `"tcp4"`, and
`"tcp6"`, the Go 1.0 implementation silently accepted any string. The Go
1.1 implementation returns an error if the network is not one of those
strings. The same is true of the other protocol-specific resolvers
[`ResolveIPAddr`](/pkg/net/#ResolveIPAddr),
[`ResolveUDPAddr`](/pkg/net/#ResolveUDPAddr), and
[`ResolveUnixAddr`](/pkg/net/#ResolveUnixAddr).

The previous implementation of
[`ListenUnixgram`](/pkg/net/#ListenUnixgram) returned a
[`UDPConn`](/pkg/net/#UDPConn) as a representation of the connection
endpoint. The Go 1.1 implementation instead returns a
[`UnixConn`](/pkg/net/#UnixConn) to allow reading and writing with its
[`ReadFrom`](/pkg/net/#UnixConn.ReadFrom) and
[`WriteTo`](/pkg/net/#UnixConn.WriteTo) methods.

The data structures [`IPAddr`](/pkg/net/#IPAddr),
[`TCPAddr`](/pkg/net/#TCPAddr), and [`UDPAddr`](/pkg/net/#UDPAddr) add a
new string field called `Zone`. Code using untagged composite literals
(e.g. `net.TCPAddr{ip, port}`) instead of tagged literals
(`net.TCPAddr{IP: ip, Port: port}`) will break due to the new field. The
Go 1 compatibility rules allow this change: client code must use tagged
literals to avoid such breakages.

*Updating*: To correct breakage caused by the new struct field, `go fix`
will rewrite code to add tags for these types. More generally, `go vet`
will identify composite literals that should be revised to use field
tags.

### reflect

The [`reflect`](/pkg/reflect/) package has several significant
additions.

It is now possible to run a "select" statement using the `reflect`
package; see the description of [`Select`](/pkg/reflect/#Select) and
[`SelectCase`](/pkg/reflect/#SelectCase) for details.

The new method [`Value.Convert`](/pkg/reflect/#Value.Convert) (or
[`Type.ConvertibleTo`](/pkg/reflect/#Type)) provides functionality to
execute a Go conversion or type assertion operation on a
[`Value`](/pkg/reflect/#Value) (or test for its possibility).

The new function [`MakeFunc`](/pkg/reflect/#MakeFunc) creates a wrapper
function to make it easier to call a function with existing
[`Values`](/pkg/reflect/#Value), doing the standard Go conversions among
the arguments, for instance to pass an actual `int` to a formal
`interface{}`.

Finally, the new functions [`ChanOf`](/pkg/reflect/#ChanOf),
[`MapOf`](/pkg/reflect/#MapOf) and [`SliceOf`](/pkg/reflect/#SliceOf)
construct new [`Types`](/pkg/reflect/#Type) from existing types, for
example to construct the type `[]T` given only `T`.

### time

On FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, OS X and OpenBSD, previous versions of the
[`time`](/pkg/time/) package returned times with microsecond precision.
The Go 1.1 implementation on these systems now returns times with
nanosecond precision. Programs that write to an external format with
microsecond precision and read it back, expecting to recover the
original value, will be affected by the loss of precision. There are two
new methods of [`Time`](/pkg/time/#Time),
[`Round`](/pkg/time/#Time.Round) and
[`Truncate`](/pkg/time/#Time.Truncate), that can be used to remove
precision from a time before passing it to external storage.

The new method [`YearDay`](/pkg/time/#Time.YearDay) returns the
one-indexed integral day number of the year specified by the time value.

The [`Timer`](/pkg/time/#Timer) type has a new method
[`Reset`](/pkg/time/#Timer.Reset) that modifies the timer to expire
after a specified duration.

Finally, the new function
[`ParseInLocation`](/pkg/time/#ParseInLocation) is like the existing
[`Parse`](/pkg/time/#Parse) but parses the time in the context of a
location (time zone), ignoring time zone information in the parsed
string. This function addresses a common source of confusion in the time
API.

*Updating*: Code that needs to read and write times using an external
format with lower precision should be modified to use the new methods.

### Exp and old subtrees moved to go.exp and go.text subrepositories {#exp_old}

To make it easier for binary distributions to access them if desired,
the `exp` and `old` source subtrees, which are not included in binary
distributions, have been moved to the new `go.exp` subrepository at
`code.google.com/p/go.exp`. To access the `ssa` package, for example,
run

    $ go get code.google.com/p/go.exp/ssa

and then in Go source,

    import "code.google.com/p/go.exp/ssa"

The old package `exp/norm` has also been moved, but to a new repository
`go.text`, where the Unicode APIs and other text-related packages will
be developed.

### New packages {#new_packages}

There are three new packages.

- The [`go/format`](/pkg/go/format/) package provides a convenient way
  for a program to access the formatting capabilities of the
  [`go fmt`](/cmd/go/#hdr-Run_gofmt_on_package_sources) command. It has
  two functions, [`Node`](/pkg/go/format/#Node) to format a Go parser
  [`Node`](/pkg/go/ast/#Node), and [`Source`](/pkg/go/format/#Source) to
  reformat arbitrary Go source code into the standard format as provided
  by the [`go fmt`](/cmd/go/#hdr-Run_gofmt_on_package_sources) command.
- The [`net/http/cookiejar`](/pkg/net/http/cookiejar/) package provides
  the basics for managing HTTP cookies.
- The [`runtime/race`](/pkg/runtime/race/) package provides low-level
  facilities for data race detection. It is internal to the race
  detector and does not otherwise export any user-visible functionality.

### Minor changes to the library {#minor_library_changes}

The following list summarizes a number of minor changes to the library,
mostly additions. See the relevant package documentation for more
information about each change.

- The [`bytes`](/pkg/bytes/) package has two new functions,
  [`TrimPrefix`](/pkg/bytes/#TrimPrefix) and
  [`TrimSuffix`](/pkg/bytes/#TrimSuffix), with self-evident properties.
  Also, the [`Buffer`](/pkg/bytes/#Buffer) type has a new method
  [`Grow`](/pkg/bytes/#Buffer.Grow) that provides some control over
  memory allocation inside the buffer. Finally, the
  [`Reader`](/pkg/bytes/#Reader) type now has a
  [`WriteTo`](/pkg/strings/#Reader.WriteTo) method so it implements the
  [`io.WriterTo`](/pkg/io/#WriterTo) interface.
- The [`compress/gzip`](/pkg/compress/gzip/) package has a new
  [`Flush`](/pkg/compress/gzip/#Writer.Flush) method for its
  [`Writer`](/pkg/compress/gzip/#Writer) type that flushes its
  underlying `flate.Writer`.
- The [`crypto/hmac`](/pkg/crypto/hmac/) package has a new function,
  [`Equal`](/pkg/crypto/hmac/#Equal), to compare two MACs.
- The [`crypto/x509`](/pkg/crypto/x509/) package now supports PEM blocks
  (see [`DecryptPEMBlock`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#DecryptPEMBlock) for
  instance), and a new function
  [`ParseECPrivateKey`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#ParseECPrivateKey) to parse
  elliptic curve private keys.
- The [`database/sql`](/pkg/database/sql/) package has a new
  [`Ping`](/pkg/database/sql/#DB.Ping) method for its
  [`DB`](/pkg/database/sql/#DB) type that tests the health of the
  connection.
- The [`database/sql/driver`](/pkg/database/sql/driver/) package has a
  new [`Queryer`](/pkg/database/sql/driver/#Queryer) interface that a
  [`Conn`](/pkg/database/sql/driver/#Conn) may implement to improve
  performance.
- The [`encoding/json`](/pkg/encoding/json/) package's
  [`Decoder`](/pkg/encoding/json/#Decoder) has a new method
  [`Buffered`](/pkg/encoding/json/#Decoder.Buffered) to provide access
  to the remaining data in its buffer, as well as a new method
  [`UseNumber`](/pkg/encoding/json/#Decoder.UseNumber) to unmarshal a
  value into the new type [`Number`](/pkg/encoding/json/#Number), a
  string, rather than a float64.
- The [`encoding/xml`](/pkg/encoding/xml/) package has a new function,
  [`EscapeText`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#EscapeText), which writes escaped
  XML output, and a method on [`Encoder`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Encoder),
  [`Indent`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Encoder.Indent), to specify indented
  output.
- In the [`go/ast`](/pkg/go/ast/) package, a new type
  [`CommentMap`](/pkg/go/ast/#CommentMap) and associated methods makes
  it easier to extract and process comments in Go programs.
- In the [`go/doc`](/pkg/go/doc/) package, the parser now keeps better
  track of stylized annotations such as `TODO(joe)` throughout the code,
  information that the [`godoc`](/cmd/godoc/) command can filter or
  present according to the value of the `-notes` flag.
- The undocumented and only partially implemented "noescape" feature of
  the [`html/template`](/pkg/html/template/) package has been removed;
  programs that depend on it will break.
- The [`image/jpeg`](/pkg/image/jpeg/) package now reads progressive
  JPEG files and handles a few more subsampling configurations.
- The [`io`](/pkg/io/) package now exports the
  [`io.ByteWriter`](/pkg/io/#ByteWriter) interface to capture the common
  functionality of writing a byte at a time. It also exports a new
  error, [`ErrNoProgress`](/pkg/io/#ErrNoProgress), used to indicate a
  `Read` implementation is looping without delivering data.
- The [`log/syslog`](/pkg/log/syslog/) package now provides better
  support for OS-specific logging features.
- The [`math/big`](/pkg/math/big/) package's [`Int`](/pkg/math/big/#Int)
  type now has methods [`MarshalJSON`](/pkg/math/big/#Int.MarshalJSON)
  and [`UnmarshalJSON`](/pkg/math/big/#Int.UnmarshalJSON) to convert to
  and from a JSON representation. Also, [`Int`](/pkg/math/big/#Int) can
  now convert directly to and from a `uint64` using
  [`Uint64`](/pkg/math/big/#Int.Uint64) and
  [`SetUint64`](/pkg/math/big/#Int.SetUint64), while
  [`Rat`](/pkg/math/big/#Rat) can do the same with `float64` using
  [`Float64`](/pkg/math/big/#Rat.Float64) and
  [`SetFloat64`](/pkg/math/big/#Rat.SetFloat64).
- The [`mime/multipart`](/pkg/mime/multipart/) package has a new method
  for its [`Writer`](/pkg/mime/multipart/#Writer),
  [`SetBoundary`](/pkg/mime/multipart/#Writer.SetBoundary), to define
  the boundary separator used to package the output. The
  [`Reader`](/pkg/mime/multipart/#Reader) also now transparently decodes
  any `quoted-printable` parts and removes the
  `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header when doing so.
- The [`net`](/pkg/net/) package's
  [`ListenUnixgram`](/pkg/net/#ListenUnixgram) function has changed
  return types: it now returns a [`UnixConn`](/pkg/net/#UnixConn) rather
  than a [`UDPConn`](/pkg/net/#UDPConn), which was clearly a mistake in
  Go 1.0. Since this API change fixes a bug, it is permitted by the Go 1
  compatibility rules.
- The [`net`](/pkg/net/) package includes a new type,
  [`Dialer`](/pkg/net/#Dialer), to supply options to
  [`Dial`](/pkg/net/#Dialer.Dial).
- The [`net`](/pkg/net/) package adds support for link-local IPv6
  addresses with zone qualifiers, such as `fe80::1%lo0`. The address
  structures [`IPAddr`](/pkg/net/#IPAddr),
  [`UDPAddr`](/pkg/net/#UDPAddr), and [`TCPAddr`](/pkg/net/#TCPAddr)
  record the zone in a new field, and functions that expect string forms
  of these addresses, such as [`Dial`](/pkg/net/#Dial),
  [`ResolveIPAddr`](/pkg/net/#ResolveIPAddr),
  [`ResolveUDPAddr`](/pkg/net/#ResolveUDPAddr), and
  [`ResolveTCPAddr`](/pkg/net/#ResolveTCPAddr), now accept the
  zone-qualified form.
- The [`net`](/pkg/net/) package adds [`LookupNS`](/pkg/net/#LookupNS)
  to its suite of resolving functions. `LookupNS` returns the [NS
  records](/pkg/net/#NS) for a host name.
- The [`net`](/pkg/net/) package adds protocol-specific packet reading
  and writing methods to [`IPConn`](/pkg/net/#IPConn)
  ([`ReadMsgIP`](/pkg/net/#IPConn.ReadMsgIP) and
  [`WriteMsgIP`](/pkg/net/#IPConn.WriteMsgIP)) and
  [`UDPConn`](/pkg/net/#UDPConn)
  ([`ReadMsgUDP`](/pkg/net/#UDPConn.ReadMsgUDP) and
  [`WriteMsgUDP`](/pkg/net/#UDPConn.WriteMsgUDP)). These are specialized
  versions of [`PacketConn`](/pkg/net/#PacketConn)'s `ReadFrom` and
  `WriteTo` methods that provide access to out-of-band data associated
  with the packets.
- The [`net`](/pkg/net/) package adds methods to
  [`UnixConn`](/pkg/net/#UnixConn) to allow closing half of the
  connection ([`CloseRead`](/pkg/net/#UnixConn.CloseRead) and
  [`CloseWrite`](/pkg/net/#UnixConn.CloseWrite)), matching the existing
  methods of [`TCPConn`](/pkg/net/#TCPConn).
- The [`net/http`](/pkg/net/http/) package includes several new
  additions. [`ParseTime`](/pkg/net/http/#ParseTime) parses a time
  string, trying several common HTTP time formats. The
  [`PostFormValue`](/pkg/net/http/#Request.PostFormValue) method of
  [`Request`](/pkg/net/http/#Request) is like
  [`FormValue`](/pkg/net/http/#Request.FormValue) but ignores URL
  parameters. The [`CloseNotifier`](/pkg/net/http/#CloseNotifier)
  interface provides a mechanism for a server handler to discover when a
  client has disconnected. The `ServeMux` type now has a
  [`Handler`](/pkg/net/http/#ServeMux.Handler) method to access a path's
  `Handler` without executing it. The `Transport` can now cancel an
  in-flight request with
  [`CancelRequest`](/pkg/net/http/#Transport.CancelRequest). Finally,
  the Transport is now more aggressive at closing TCP connections when a
  [`Response.Body`](/pkg/net/http/#Response) is closed before being
  fully consumed.
- The [`net/mail`](/pkg/net/mail/) package has two new functions,
  [`ParseAddress`](/pkg/net/mail/#ParseAddress) and
  [`ParseAddressList`](/pkg/net/mail/#ParseAddressList), to parse RFC
  5322-formatted mail addresses into [`Address`](/pkg/net/mail/#Address)
  structures.
- The [`net/smtp`](/pkg/net/smtp/) package's
  [`Client`](/pkg/net/smtp/#Client) type has a new method,
  [`Hello`](/pkg/net/smtp/#Client.Hello), which transmits a `HELO` or
  `EHLO` message to the server.
- The [`net/textproto`](/pkg/net/textproto/) package has two new
  functions, [`TrimBytes`](/pkg/net/textproto/#TrimBytes) and
  [`TrimString`](/pkg/net/textproto/#TrimString), which do ASCII-only
  trimming of leading and trailing spaces.
- The new method [`os.FileMode.IsRegular`](/pkg/os/#FileMode.IsRegular)
  makes it easy to ask if a file is a plain file.
- The [`os/signal`](/pkg/os/signal/) package has a new function,
  [`Stop`](/pkg/os/signal/#Stop), which stops the package delivering any
  further signals to the channel.
- The [`regexp`](/pkg/regexp/) package now supports Unix-original
  leftmost-longest matches through the
  [`Regexp.Longest`](/pkg/regexp/#Regexp.Longest) method, while
  [`Regexp.Split`](/pkg/regexp/#Regexp.Split) slices strings into pieces
  based on separators defined by the regular expression.
- The [`runtime/debug`](/pkg/runtime/debug/) package has three new
  functions regarding memory usage. The
  [`FreeOSMemory`](/pkg/runtime/debug/#FreeOSMemory) function triggers a
  run of the garbage collector and then attempts to return unused memory
  to the operating system; the
  [`ReadGCStats`](/pkg/runtime/debug/#ReadGCStats) function retrieves
  statistics about the collector; and
  [`SetGCPercent`](/pkg/runtime/debug/#SetGCPercent) provides a
  programmatic way to control how often the collector runs, including
  disabling it altogether.
- The [`sort`](/pkg/sort/) package has a new function,
  [`Reverse`](/pkg/sort/#Reverse). Wrapping the argument of a call to
  [`sort.Sort`](/pkg/sort/#Sort) with a call to `Reverse` causes the
  sort order to be reversed.
- The [`strings`](/pkg/strings/) package has two new functions,
  [`TrimPrefix`](/pkg/strings/#TrimPrefix) and
  [`TrimSuffix`](/pkg/strings/#TrimSuffix) with self-evident properties,
  and the new method [`Reader.WriteTo`](/pkg/strings/#Reader.WriteTo) so
  the [`Reader`](/pkg/strings/#Reader) type now implements the
  [`io.WriterTo`](/pkg/io/#WriterTo) interface.
- The [`syscall`](/pkg/syscall/) package's
  [`Fchflags`](/pkg/syscall/#Fchflags) function on various BSDs
  (including Darwin) has changed signature. It now takes an int as the
  first parameter instead of a string. Since this API change fixes a
  bug, it is permitted by the Go 1 compatibility rules.
- The [`syscall`](/pkg/syscall/) package also has received many updates
  to make it more inclusive of constants and system calls for each
  supported operating system.
- The [`testing`](/pkg/testing/) package now automates the generation of
  allocation statistics in tests and benchmarks using the new
  [`AllocsPerRun`](/pkg/testing/#AllocsPerRun) function. And the
  [`ReportAllocs`](/pkg/testing/#B.ReportAllocs) method on
  [`testing.B`](/pkg/testing/#B) will enable printing of memory
  allocation statistics for the calling benchmark. It also introduces
  the [`AllocsPerOp`](/pkg/testing/#BenchmarkResult.AllocsPerOp) method
  of [`BenchmarkResult`](/pkg/testing/#BenchmarkResult). There is also a
  new [`Verbose`](/pkg/testing/#Verbose) function to test the state of
  the `-v` command-line flag, and a new [`Skip`](/pkg/testing/#B.Skip)
  method of [`testing.B`](/pkg/testing/#B) and
  [`testing.T`](/pkg/testing/#T) to simplify skipping an inappropriate
  test.
- In the [`text/template`](/pkg/text/template/) and
  [`html/template`](/pkg/html/template/) packages, templates can now use
  parentheses to group the elements of pipelines, simplifying the
  construction of complex pipelines. Also, as part of the new parser,
  the [`Node`](/pkg/text/template/parse/#Node) interface got two new
  methods to provide better error reporting. Although this violates the
  Go 1 compatibility rules, no existing code should be affected because
  this interface is explicitly intended only to be used by the
  [`text/template`](/pkg/text/template/) and
  [`html/template`](/pkg/html/template/) packages and there are
  safeguards to guarantee that.
- The implementation of the [`unicode`](/pkg/unicode/) package has been
  updated to Unicode version 6.2.0.
- In the [`unicode/utf8`](/pkg/unicode/utf8/) package, the new function
  [`ValidRune`](/pkg/unicode/utf8/#ValidRune) reports whether the rune
  is a valid Unicode code point. To be valid, a rune must be in range
  and not be a surrogate half.
