## Introduction to Go 1.19 {#introduction}

The latest Go release, version 1.19, arrives five months after [Go
1.18](/doc/go1.18). Most of its changes are in the implementation of the
toolchain, runtime, and libraries. As always, the release maintains the
Go 1 [promise of compatibility](/doc/go1compat). We expect almost all Go
programs to continue to compile and run as before.

## Changes to the language {#language}

There is only one small change to the language, a [very small
correction](/issue/52038) to the [scope of type parameters in method
declarations](/ref/spec#Declarations_and_scope). Existing programs are
unaffected.

## Memory Model {#mem}

The [Go memory model](/ref/mem) has been
[revised](https://research.swtch.com/gomm){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} to align Go with the memory model used by C, C++, Java,
JavaScript, Rust, and Swift. Go only provides sequentially consistent
atomics, not any of the more relaxed forms found in other languages.
Along with the memory model update, Go 1.19 introduces [new types in the
`sync/atomic` package](#atomic_types) that make it easier to use atomic
values, such as [atomic.Int64](/pkg/sync/atomic/#Int64) and
[atomic.Pointer\[T\]](/pkg/sync/atomic/#Pointer).

## Ports

### LoongArch 64-bit {#loong64}

Go 1.19 adds support for the Loongson 64-bit architecture
[LoongArch](https://loongson.github.io/LoongArch-Documentation){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} on Linux (`GOOS=linux`, `GOARCH=loong64`). The
implemented ABI is LP64D. Minimum kernel version supported is 5.19.

Note that most existing commercial Linux distributions for LoongArch
come with older kernels, with a historical incompatible system call ABI.
Compiled binaries will not work on these systems, even if statically
linked. Users on such unsupported systems are limited to the
distribution-provided Go package.

### RISC-V {#riscv64}

The `riscv64` port now supports passing function arguments and result
using registers. Benchmarking shows typical performance improvements of
10% or more on `riscv64`.

## Tools

### Doc Comments {#go-doc}

Go 1.19 adds support for links, lists, and clearer headings in doc
comments. As part of this change, [`gofmt`](/cmd/gofmt) now reformats
doc comments to make their rendered meaning clearer. See "[Go Doc
Comments](/doc/comment)" for syntax details and descriptions of common
mistakes now highlighted by `gofmt`. As another part of this change, the
new package [go/doc/comment](/pkg/go/doc/comment/) provides parsing and
reformatting of doc comments as well as support for rendering them to
HTML, Markdown, and text.

### New `unix` build constraint {#go-unix}

The build constraint `unix` is now recognized in `//go:build` lines. The
constraint is satisfied if the target operating system, also known as
`GOOS`, is a Unix or Unix-like system. For the 1.19 release it is
satisfied if `GOOS` is one of `aix`, `android`, `darwin`, `dragonfly`,
`freebsd`, `hurd`, `illumos`, `ios`, `linux`, `netbsd`, `openbsd`, or
`solaris`. In future releases the `unix` constraint may match additional
newly supported operating systems.

### Go command

The `-trimpath` flag, if set, is now included in the build settings
stamped into Go binaries by `go` `build`, and can be examined using
[`go` `version`
`-m`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Print_Go_version){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} or
[`debug.ReadBuildInfo`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/debug#ReadBuildInfo){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"}.

`go` `generate` now sets the `GOROOT` environment variable explicitly in
the generator's environment, so that generators can locate the correct
`GOROOT` even if built with `-trimpath`.

`go` `test` and `go` `generate` now place `GOROOT/bin` at the beginning
of the `PATH` used for the subprocess, so tests and generators that
execute the `go` command will resolve it to same `GOROOT`.

`go` `env` now quotes entries that contain spaces in the `CGO_CFLAGS`,
`CGO_CPPFLAGS`, `CGO_CXXFLAGS`, `CGO_FFLAGS`, `CGO_LDFLAGS`, and
`GOGCCFLAGS` variables it reports.

`go` `list` `-json` now accepts a comma-separated list of JSON fields to
populate. If a list is specified, the JSON output will include only
those fields, and `go` `list` may avoid work to compute fields that are
not included. In some cases, this may suppress errors that would
otherwise be reported.

The `go` command now caches information necessary to load some modules,
which should result in a speed-up of some `go` `list` invocations.

### Vet

The `vet` checker "errorsas" now reports when
[`errors.As`](/pkg/errors/#As) is called with a second argument of type
`*error`, a common mistake.

## Runtime

The runtime now includes support for a soft memory limit. This memory
limit includes the Go heap and all other memory managed by the runtime,
and excludes external memory sources such as mappings of the binary
itself, memory managed in other languages, and memory held by the
operating system on behalf of the Go program. This limit may be managed
via [`runtime/debug.SetMemoryLimit`](/pkg/runtime/debug/#SetMemoryLimit)
or the equivalent
[`GOMEMLIMIT`](/pkg/runtime/#hdr-Environment_Variables) environment
variable. The limit works in conjunction with
[`runtime/debug.SetGCPercent`](/pkg/runtime/debug/#SetGCPercent) /
[`GOGC`](/pkg/runtime/#hdr-Environment_Variables), and will be respected
even if `GOGC=off`, allowing Go programs to always make maximal use of
their memory limit, improving resource efficiency in some cases. See
[the GC guide](/doc/gc-guide) for a detailed guide explaining the soft
memory limit in more detail, as well as a variety of common use-cases
and scenarios. Please note that small memory limits, on the order of
tens of megabytes or less, are less likely to be respected due to
external latency factors, such as OS scheduling. See [issue
52433](/issue/52433) for more details. Larger memory limits, on the
order of hundreds of megabytes or more, are stable and production-ready.

In order to limit the effects of GC thrashing when the program's live
heap size approaches the soft memory limit, the Go runtime also attempts
to limit total GC CPU utilization to 50%, excluding idle time, choosing
to use more memory over preventing application progress. In practice, we
expect this limit to only play a role in exceptional cases, and the new
[runtime metric](/pkg/runtime/metrics/#hdr-Supported_metrics)
`/gc/limiter/last-enabled:gc-cycle` reports when this last occurred.

The runtime now schedules many fewer GC worker goroutines on idle
operating system threads when the application is idle enough to force a
periodic GC cycle.

The runtime will now allocate initial goroutine stacks based on the
historic average stack usage of goroutines. This avoids some of the
early stack growth and copying needed in the average case in exchange
for at most 2x wasted space on below-average goroutines.

On Unix operating systems, Go programs that import package
[os](/pkg/os/) now automatically increase the open file limit
(`RLIMIT_NOFILE`) to the maximum allowed value; that is, they change the
soft limit to match the hard limit. This corrects artificially low
limits set on some systems for compatibility with very old C programs
using the
[*select*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(Unix)){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} system call. Go programs are not helped by that limit,
and instead even simple programs like `gofmt` often ran out of file
descriptors on such systems when processing many files in parallel. One
impact of this change is that Go programs that in turn execute very old
C programs in child processes may run those programs with too high a
limit. This can be corrected by setting the hard limit before invoking
the Go program.

Unrecoverable fatal errors (such as concurrent map writes, or unlock of
unlocked mutexes) now print a simpler traceback excluding runtime
metadata (equivalent to a fatal panic) unless `GOTRACEBACK=system` or
`crash`. Runtime-internal fatal error tracebacks always include full
metadata regardless of the value of `GOTRACEBACK`

Support for debugger-injected function calls has been added on ARM64,
enabling users to call functions from their binary in an interactive
debugging session when using a debugger that is updated to make use of
this functionality.

The [address sanitizer support added in Go
1.18](/doc/go1.18#go-build-asan) now handles function arguments and
global variables more precisely.

## Compiler

The compiler now uses a [jump
table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_table){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} to implement large integer and string switch
statements. Performance improvements for the switch statement vary but
can be on the order of 20% faster. (`GOARCH=amd64` and `GOARCH=arm64`
only)

The Go compiler now requires the `-p=importpath` flag to build a
linkable object file. This is already supplied by the `go` command and
by Bazel. Any other build systems that invoke the Go compiler directly
will need to make sure they pass this flag as well.

The Go compiler no longer accepts the `-importmap` flag. Build systems
that invoke the Go compiler directly must use the `-importcfg` flag
instead.

## Assembler

Like the compiler, the assembler now requires the `-p=importpath` flag
to build a linkable object file. This is already supplied by the `go`
command. Any other build systems that invoke the Go assembler directly
will need to make sure they pass this flag as well.

## Linker

On ELF platforms, the linker now emits compressed DWARF sections in the
standard gABI format (`SHF_COMPRESSED`), instead of the legacy `.zdebug`
format.

## Standard library {#library}

### New atomic types {#atomic_types}

The [`sync/atomic`](/pkg/sync/atomic/) package defines new atomic types
[`Bool`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#Bool), [`Int32`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#Int32),
[`Int64`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#Int64),
[`Uint32`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#Uint32),
[`Uint64`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#Uint64),
[`Uintptr`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#Uintptr), and
[`Pointer`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#Pointer). These types hide the underlying
values so that all accesses are forced to use the atomic APIs.
[`Pointer`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#Pointer) also avoids the need to convert
to [`unsafe.Pointer`](/pkg/unsafe/#Pointer) at call sites.
[`Int64`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#Int64) and
[`Uint64`](/pkg/sync/atomic/#Uint64) are automatically aligned to 64-bit
boundaries in structs and allocated data, even on 32-bit systems.

### PATH lookups {#os-exec-path}

[`Command`](/pkg/os/exec/#Command) and
[`LookPath`](/pkg/os/exec/#LookPath) no longer allow results from a PATH
search to be found relative to the current directory. This removes a
[common source of security problems](/blog/path-security) but may also
break existing programs that depend on using, say,
`exec.Command("prog")` to run a binary named `prog` (or, on Windows,
`prog.exe`) in the current directory. See the [`os/exec`](/pkg/os/exec/)
package documentation for information about how best to update such
programs.

On Windows, `Command` and `LookPath` now respect the
[`NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processenv/nf-processenv-needcurrentdirectoryforexepatha){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"} environment variable, making it possible to disable the
default implicit search of "`.`" in PATH lookups on Windows systems.

### Minor changes to the library {#minor_library_changes}

As always, there are various minor changes and updates to the library,
made with the Go 1 [promise of compatibility](/doc/go1compat) in mind.
There are also various performance improvements, not enumerated here.

#### [archive/zip](/pkg/archive/zip/) {#archivezippkgarchivezip}

[`Reader`](/pkg/archive/zip/#Reader) now ignores non-ZIP data at the
start of a ZIP file, matching most other implementations. This is
necessary to read some Java JAR files, among other uses.

#### [crypto/elliptic](/pkg/crypto/elliptic/) {#cryptoellipticpkgcryptoelliptic}

Operating on invalid curve points (those for which the `IsOnCurve`
method returns false, and which are never returned by `Unmarshal` or by
a `Curve` method operating on a valid point) has always been undefined
behavior and can lead to key recovery attacks. If an invalid point is
supplied to [`Marshal`](/pkg/crypto/elliptic/#Marshal),
[`MarshalCompressed`](/pkg/crypto/elliptic/#MarshalCompressed),
[`Add`](/pkg/crypto/elliptic/#Curve.Add),
[`Double`](/pkg/crypto/elliptic/#Curve.Double), or
[`ScalarMult`](/pkg/crypto/elliptic/#Curve.ScalarMult), they will now
panic.

`ScalarBaseMult` operations on the `P224`, `P384`, and `P521` curves are
now up to three times faster, leading to similar speedups in some ECDSA
operations. The generic (not platform optimized) `P256` implementation
was replaced with one derived from a formally verified model; this might
lead to significant slowdowns on 32-bit platforms.

#### [crypto/rand](/pkg/crypto/rand/) {#cryptorandpkgcryptorand}

[`Read`](/pkg/crypto/rand/#Read) no longer buffers random data obtained
from the operating system between calls. Applications that perform many
small reads at high frequency might choose to wrap
[`Reader`](/pkg/crypto/rand/#Reader) in a
[`bufio.Reader`](/pkg/bufio/#Reader) for performance reasons, taking
care to use [`io.ReadFull`](/pkg/io/#ReadFull) to ensure no partial
reads occur.

On Plan 9, `Read` has been reimplemented, replacing the ANSI X9.31
algorithm with a fast key erasure generator.

The [`Prime`](/pkg/crypto/rand/#Prime) implementation was changed to use
only rejection sampling, which removes a bias when generating small
primes in non-cryptographic contexts, removes one possible minor timing
leak, and better aligns the behavior with BoringSSL, all while
simplifying the implementation. The change does produce different
outputs for a given random source stream compared to the previous
implementation, which can break tests written expecting specific results
from specific deterministic random sources. To help prevent such
problems in the future, the implementation is now intentionally
non-deterministic with respect to the input stream.

#### [crypto/tls](/pkg/crypto/tls/) {#cryptotlspkgcryptotls}

The `GODEBUG` option `tls10default=1` has been removed. It is still
possible to enable TLS 1.0 client-side by setting
[`Config.MinVersion`](/pkg/crypto/tls/#Config.MinVersion).

The TLS server and client now reject duplicate extensions in TLS
handshakes, as required by RFC 5246, Section 7.4.1.4 and RFC 8446,
Section 4.2.

#### [crypto/x509](/pkg/crypto/x509/) {#cryptox509pkgcryptox509}

[`CreateCertificate`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#CreateCertificate) no longer
supports creating certificates with `SignatureAlgorithm` set to
`MD5WithRSA`.

`CreateCertificate` no longer accepts negative serial numbers.

`CreateCertificate` will not emit an empty SEQUENCE anymore when the
produced certificate has no extensions.

Removal of the `GODEBUG` option`x509sha1=1`, originally planned for Go
1.19, has been rescheduled to a future release. Applications using it
should work on migrating. Practical attacks against SHA-1 have been
demonstrated since 2017 and publicly trusted Certificate Authorities
have not issued SHA-1 certificates since 2015.

[`ParseCertificate`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#ParseCertificate) and
[`ParseCertificateRequest`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#ParseCertificateRequest)
now reject certificates and CSRs which contain duplicate extensions.

The new [`CertPool.Clone`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#CertPool.Clone) and
[`CertPool.Equal`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#CertPool.Equal) methods allow
cloning a `CertPool` and checking the equivalence of two `CertPool`s
respectively.

The new function
[`ParseRevocationList`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#ParseRevocationList) provides
a faster, safer to use CRL parser which returns a
[`RevocationList`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#RevocationList). Parsing a CRL also
populates the new `RevocationList` fields `RawIssuer`, `Signature`,
`AuthorityKeyId`, and `Extensions`, which are ignored by
[`CreateRevocationList`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#CreateRevocationList).

The new method
[`RevocationList.CheckSignatureFrom`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#RevocationList.CheckSignatureFrom)
checks that the signature on a CRL is a valid signature from a
[`Certificate`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#Certificate).

The [`ParseCRL`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#ParseCRL) and
[`ParseDERCRL`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#ParseDERCRL) functions are now
deprecated in favor of `ParseRevocationList`. The
[`Certificate.CheckCRLSignature`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#Certificate.CheckCRLSignature)
method is deprecated in favor of `RevocationList.CheckSignatureFrom`.

The path builder of
[`Certificate.Verify`](/pkg/crypto/x509/#Certificate.Verify) was
overhauled and should now produce better chains and/or be more efficient
in complicated scenarios. Name constraints are now also enforced on
non-leaf certificates.

#### [crypto/x509/pkix](/pkg/crypto/x509/pkix/) {#cryptox509pkixpkgcryptox509pkix}

The types [`CertificateList`](/pkg/crypto/x509/pkix/#CertificateList)
and [`TBSCertificateList`](/pkg/crypto/x509/pkix/#TBSCertificateList)
have been deprecated. The new [`crypto/x509` CRL
functionality](#crypto/x509) should be used instead.

#### [debug/elf](/pkg/debug/elf/) {#debugelfpkgdebugelf}

The new `EM_LOONGARCH` and `R_LARCH_*` constants support the loong64
port.

#### [debug/pe](/pkg/debug/pe/) {#debugpepkgdebugpe}

The new
[`File.COFFSymbolReadSectionDefAux`](/pkg/debug/pe/#File.COFFSymbolReadSectionDefAux)
method, which returns a
[`COFFSymbolAuxFormat5`](/pkg/debug/pe/#COFFSymbolAuxFormat5), provides
access to COMDAT information in PE file sections. These are supported by
new `IMAGE_COMDAT_*` and `IMAGE_SCN_*` constants.

#### [encoding/binary](/pkg/encoding/binary/) {#encodingbinarypkgencodingbinary}

The new interface
[`AppendByteOrder`](/pkg/encoding/binary/#AppendByteOrder) provides
efficient methods for appending a `uint16`, `uint32`, or `uint64` to a
byte slice. [`BigEndian`](/pkg/encoding/binary/#BigEndian) and
[`LittleEndian`](/pkg/encoding/binary/#LittleEndian) now implement this
interface.

Similarly, the new functions
[`AppendUvarint`](/pkg/encoding/binary/#AppendUvarint) and
[`AppendVarint`](/pkg/encoding/binary/#AppendVarint) are efficient
appending versions of [`PutUvarint`](/pkg/encoding/binary/#PutUvarint)
and [`PutVarint`](/pkg/encoding/binary/#PutVarint).

#### [encoding/csv](/pkg/encoding/csv/) {#encodingcsvpkgencodingcsv}

The new method
[`Reader.InputOffset`](/pkg/encoding/csv/#Reader.InputOffset) reports
the reader's current input position as a byte offset, analogous to
`encoding/json`'s
[`Decoder.InputOffset`](/pkg/encoding/json/#Decoder.InputOffset).

#### [encoding/xml](/pkg/encoding/xml/) {#encodingxmlpkgencodingxml}

The new method [`Decoder.InputPos`](/pkg/encoding/xml/#Decoder.InputPos)
reports the reader's current input position as a line and column,
analogous to `encoding/csv`'s
[`Decoder.FieldPos`](/pkg/encoding/csv/#Decoder.FieldPos).

#### [flag](/pkg/flag/) {#flagpkgflag}

The new function [`TextVar`](/pkg/flag/#TextVar) defines a flag with a
value implementing
[`encoding.TextUnmarshaler`](/pkg/encoding/#TextUnmarshaler), allowing
command-line flag variables to have types such as
[`big.Int`](/pkg/math/big/#Int), [`netip.Addr`](/pkg/net/netip/#Addr),
and [`time.Time`](/pkg/time/#Time).

#### [fmt](/pkg/fmt/) {#fmtpkgfmt}

The new functions [`Append`](/pkg/fmt/#Append),
[`Appendf`](/pkg/fmt/#Appendf), and [`Appendln`](/pkg/fmt/#Appendln)
append formatted data to byte slices.

#### [go/parser](/pkg/go/parser/) {#goparserpkggoparser}

The parser now recognizes `~x` as a unary expression with operator
[token.TILDE](/pkg/go/token/#TILDE), allowing better error recovery when
a type constraint such as `~int` is used in an incorrect context.

#### [go/types](/pkg/go/types/) {#gotypespkggotypes}

The new methods [`Func.Origin`](/pkg/go/types/#Func.Origin) and
[`Var.Origin`](/pkg/go/types/#Var.Origin) return the corresponding
[`Object`](/pkg/go/types/#Object) of the generic type for synthetic
[`Func`](/pkg/go/types/#Func) and [`Var`](/pkg/go/types/#Var) objects
created during type instantiation.

It is no longer possible to produce an infinite number of
distinct-but-identical [`Named`](/pkg/go/types/#Named) type
instantiations via recursive calls to
[`Named.Underlying`](/pkg/go/types/#Named.Underlying) or
[`Named.Method`](/pkg/go/types/#Named.Method).

#### [hash/maphash](/pkg/hash/maphash/) {#hashmaphashpkghashmaphash}

The new functions [`Bytes`](/pkg/hash/maphash/#Bytes) and
[`String`](/pkg/hash/maphash/#String) provide an efficient way hash a
single byte slice or string. They are equivalent to using the more
general [`Hash`](/pkg/hash/maphash/#Hash) with a single write, but they
avoid setup overhead for small inputs.

#### [html/template](/pkg/html/template/) {#htmltemplatepkghtmltemplate}

The type [`FuncMap`](/pkg/html/template/#FuncMap) is now an alias for
`text/template`'s [`FuncMap`](/pkg/text/template/#FuncMap) instead of
its own named type. This allows writing code that operates on a
`FuncMap` from either setting.

Go 1.19.8 and later [disallow actions in ECMAScript 6 template
literals.](/pkg/html/template#hdr-Security_Model) This behavior can be
reverted by the `GODEBUG=jstmpllitinterp=1` setting.

#### [image/draw](/pkg/image/draw/) {#imagedrawpkgimagedraw}

[`Draw`](/pkg/image/draw/#Draw) with the [`Src`](/pkg/image/draw/#Src)
operator preserves non-premultiplied-alpha colors when destination and
source images are both [`image.NRGBA`](/pkg/image/#NRGBA) or both
[`image.NRGBA64`](/pkg/image/#NRGBA64). This reverts a behavior change
accidentally introduced by a Go 1.18 library optimization; the code now
matches the behavior in Go 1.17 and earlier.

#### [io](/pkg/io/) {#iopkgio}

[`NopCloser`](/pkg/io/#NopCloser)'s result now implements
[`WriterTo`](/pkg/io/#WriterTo) whenever its input does.

[`MultiReader`](/pkg/io/#MultiReader)'s result now implements
[`WriterTo`](/pkg/io/#WriterTo) unconditionally. If any underlying
reader does not implement `WriterTo`, it is simulated appropriately.

#### [mime](/pkg/mime/) {#mimepkgmime}

On Windows only, the mime package now ignores a registry entry recording
that the extension `.js` should have MIME type `text/plain`. This is a
common unintentional misconfiguration on Windows systems. The effect is
that `.js` will have the default MIME type
`text/javascript; charset=utf-8`. Applications that expect `text/plain`
on Windows must now explicitly call
[`AddExtensionType`](/pkg/mime/#AddExtensionType).

#### [mime/multipart](/pkg/mime/multipart) {#mimemultipartpkgmimemultipart}

In Go 1.19.8 and later, this package sets limits the size of the MIME
data it processes to protect against malicious inputs. `Reader.NextPart`
and `Reader.NextRawPart` limit the number of headers in a part to 10000
and `Reader.ReadForm` limits the total number of headers in all
`FileHeaders` to 10000. These limits may be adjusted with the
`GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders` setting. `Reader.ReadForm` further limits
the number of parts in a form to 1000. This limit may be adjusted with
the `GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts` setting.

#### [net](/pkg/net/) {#netpkgnet}

The pure Go resolver will now use EDNS(0) to include a suggested maximum
reply packet length, permitting reply packets to contain up to 1232
bytes (the previous maximum was 512). In the unlikely event that this
causes problems with a local DNS resolver, setting the environment
variable `GODEBUG=netdns=cgo` to use the cgo-based resolver should work.
Please report any such problems on [the issue tracker](/issue/new).

When a net package function or method returns an "I/O timeout" error,
the error will now satisfy `errors.Is(err, context.DeadlineExceeded)`.
When a net package function returns an "operation was canceled" error,
the error will now satisfy `errors.Is(err, context.Canceled)`. These
changes are intended to make it easier for code to test for cases in
which a context cancellation or timeout causes a net package function or
method to return an error, while preserving backward compatibility for
error messages.

[`Resolver.PreferGo`](/pkg/net/#Resolver.PreferGo) is now implemented on
Windows and Plan 9. It previously only worked on Unix platforms.
Combined with [`Dialer.Resolver`](/pkg/net/#Dialer.Resolver) and
[`Resolver.Dial`](/pkg/net/#Resolver.Dial), it's now possible to write
portable programs and be in control of all DNS name lookups when
dialing.

The `net` package now has initial support for the `netgo` build tag on
Windows. When used, the package uses the Go DNS client (as used by
`Resolver.PreferGo`) instead of asking Windows for DNS results. The
upstream DNS server it discovers from Windows may not yet be correct
with complex system network configurations, however.

#### [net/http](/pkg/net/http/) {#nethttppkgnethttp}

[`ResponseWriter.WriteHeader`](/pkg/net/http/#ResponseWriter) now
supports sending user-defined 1xx informational headers.

The `io.ReadCloser` returned by
[`MaxBytesReader`](/pkg/net/http/#MaxBytesReader) will now return the
defined error type [`MaxBytesError`](/pkg/net/http/#MaxBytesError) when
its read limit is exceeded.

The HTTP client will handle a 3xx response without a `Location` header
by returning it to the caller, rather than treating it as an error.

#### [net/url](/pkg/net/url/) {#neturlpkgneturl}

The new [`JoinPath`](/pkg/net/url/#JoinPath) function and
[`URL.JoinPath`](/pkg/net/url/#URL.JoinPath) method create a new `URL`
by joining a list of path elements.

The `URL` type now distinguishes between URLs with no authority and URLs
with an empty authority. For example, `http:///path` has an empty
authority (host), while `http:/path` has none.

The new [`URL`](/pkg/net/url/#URL) field `OmitHost` is set to `true`
when a `URL` has an empty authority.

#### [os/exec](/pkg/os/exec/) {#osexecpkgosexec}

A [`Cmd`](/pkg/os/exec/#Cmd) with a non-empty `Dir` field and nil `Env`
now implicitly sets the `PWD` environment variable for the subprocess to
match `Dir`.

The new method [`Cmd.Environ`](/pkg/os/exec/#Cmd.Environ) reports the
environment that would be used to run the command, including the
implicitly set `PWD` variable.

#### [reflect](/pkg/reflect/) {#reflectpkgreflect}

The method [`Value.Bytes`](/pkg/reflect/#Value.Bytes) now accepts
addressable arrays in addition to slices.

The methods [`Value.Len`](/pkg/reflect/#Value.Len) and
[`Value.Cap`](/pkg/reflect/#Value.Cap) now successfully operate on a
pointer to an array and return the length of that array, to match what
the [builtin `len` and `cap` functions
do](/ref/spec#Length_and_capacity).

#### [regexp/syntax](/pkg/regexp/syntax/) {#regexpsyntaxpkgregexpsyntax}

Go 1.18 release candidate 1, Go 1.17.8, and Go 1.16.15 included a
security fix to the regular expression parser, making it reject very
deeply nested expressions. Because Go patch releases do not introduce
new API, the parser returned
[`syntax.ErrInternalError`](/pkg/regexp/syntax/#ErrInternalError) in
this case. Go 1.19 adds a more specific error,
[`syntax.ErrNestingDepth`](/pkg/regexp/syntax/#ErrNestingDepth), which
the parser now returns instead.

#### [runtime](/pkg/runtime/) {#runtimepkgruntime}

The [`GOROOT`](/pkg/runtime/#GOROOT) function now returns the empty
string (instead of `"go"`) when the binary was built with the
`-trimpath` flag set and the `GOROOT` variable is not set in the process
environment.

#### [runtime/metrics](/pkg/runtime/metrics/) {#runtimemetricspkgruntimemetrics}

The new `/sched/gomaxprocs:threads`
[metric](/pkg/runtime/metrics/#hdr-Supported_metrics) reports the
current [`runtime.GOMAXPROCS`](/pkg/runtime/#GOMAXPROCS) value.

The new `/cgo/go-to-c-calls:calls`
[metric](/pkg/runtime/metrics/#hdr-Supported_metrics) reports the total
number of calls made from Go to C. This metric is identical to the
[`runtime.NumCgoCall`](/pkg/runtime/#NumCgoCall) function.

The new `/gc/limiter/last-enabled:gc-cycle`
[metric](/pkg/runtime/metrics/#hdr-Supported_metrics) reports the last
GC cycle when the GC CPU limiter was enabled. See the [runtime
notes](#runtime) for details about the GC CPU limiter.

#### [runtime/pprof](/pkg/runtime/pprof/) {#runtimepprofpkgruntimepprof}

Stop-the-world pause times have been significantly reduced when
collecting goroutine profiles, reducing the overall latency impact to
the application.

`MaxRSS` is now reported in heap profiles for all Unix operating systems
(it was previously only reported for `GOOS=android`, `darwin`, `ios`,
and `linux`).

#### [runtime/race](/pkg/runtime/race/) {#runtimeracepkgruntimerace}

The race detector has been upgraded to use thread sanitizer version v3
on all supported platforms except `windows/amd64` and `openbsd/amd64`,
which remain on v2. Compared to v2, it is now typically 1.5x to 2x
faster, uses half as much memory, and it supports an unlimited number of
goroutines. On Linux, the race detector now requires at least glibc
version 2.17 and GNU binutils 2.26.

The race detector is now supported on `GOARCH=s390x`.

Race detector support for `openbsd/amd64` has been removed from thread
sanitizer upstream, so it is unlikely to ever be updated from v2.

#### [runtime/trace](/pkg/runtime/trace/) {#runtimetracepkgruntimetrace}

When tracing and the [CPU profiler](/pkg/runtime/pprof/#StartCPUProfile)
are enabled simultaneously, the execution trace includes CPU profile
samples as instantaneous events.

#### [sort](/pkg/sort/) {#sortpkgsort}

The sorting algorithm has been rewritten to use [pattern-defeating
quicksort](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05123.pdf){rel="noreferrer"
target="_blank"}, which is faster for several common scenarios.

The new function [`Find`](/pkg/sort/#Find) is like
[`Search`](/pkg/sort/#Search) but often easier to use: it returns an
additional boolean reporting whether an equal value was found.

#### [strconv](/pkg/strconv/) {#strconvpkgstrconv}

[`Quote`](/pkg/strconv/#Quote) and related functions now quote the rune
U+007F as `\x7f`, not `\u007f`, for consistency with other ASCII values.

#### [syscall](/pkg/syscall/) {#syscallpkgsyscall}

On PowerPC (`GOARCH=ppc64`, `ppc64le`),
[`Syscall`](/pkg/syscall/#Syscall),
[`Syscall6`](/pkg/syscall/#Syscall6),
[`RawSyscall`](/pkg/syscall/#RawSyscall), and
[`RawSyscall6`](/pkg/syscall/#RawSyscall6) now always return 0 for
return value `r2` instead of an undefined value.

On AIX and Solaris, [`Getrusage`](/pkg/syscall/#Getrusage) is now
defined.

#### [time](/pkg/time/) {#timepkgtime}

The new method [`Duration.Abs`](/pkg/time/#Duration.Abs) provides a
convenient and safe way to take the absolute value of a duration,
converting −2⁶³ to 2⁶³−1. (This boundary case can happen as the result
of subtracting a recent time from the zero time.)

The new method [`Time.ZoneBounds`](/pkg/time/#Time.ZoneBounds) returns
the start and end times of the time zone in effect at a given time. It
can be used in a loop to enumerate all the known time zone transitions
at a given location.
