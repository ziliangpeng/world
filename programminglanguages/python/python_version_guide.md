# Python Version Selection Guide

Practical guidance for choosing Python versions, migration strategies, and understanding support timelines.

## Which Version to Use

### For New Projects
- **Python 3.11 or 3.12**: Best balance of modern features, stability, and wide support
- **Python 3.13**: Bleeding edge - great for experimenting with no-GIL and JIT, but may have ecosystem compatibility issues

### For Production Systems
- **Python 3.11**: Excellent choice - major performance gains, stable, strong ecosystem support
- **Python 3.12**: Safe choice with continued performance improvements
- **Python 3.10**: Still solid, especially if you need maximum library compatibility

### Versions to Avoid
- **Python 3.8 and older**: Already EOL or no security support
- **Python 2.7**: EOL since January 2020 - migrate immediately if still using

## Migration Considerations

### Python 2.7 → 3.x
Major breaking changes:
- `print` is a function: `print()` not `print "hello"`
- Integer division: `5/2` returns `2.5` not `2` (use `//` for floor division)
- Strings are Unicode by default
- `range()` returns iterator, not list
- Many standard library reorganizations

### Python 3.5 → 3.6+
- Start using f-strings instead of `.format()`
- Type hints become more practical

### Python 3.9 → 3.10+
- Consider pattern matching for complex conditionals
- Use `|` for type unions instead of `Union[]`

### Python 3.10 → 3.11
- Free performance boost (10-60% faster)
- No code changes required in most cases

## Performance Milestones

- **Python 3.11**: 10-60% faster than 3.10 (biggest single-version improvement)
- **Python 3.12**: Incremental improvements, especially for large applications
- **Python 3.13**: JIT enables future optimizations (current gains modest)

## Feature Adoption Timeline

**When features became mainstream:**
- **F-strings (3.6)**: Now standard, widely adopted
- **Type hints (3.5+)**: Increasingly common, especially in large codebases
- **Walrus operator (3.8)**: Growing adoption, controversial initially
- **Pattern matching (3.10)**: Still gaining traction, not yet ubiquitous
- **No-GIL (3.13)**: Experimental, not for production yet

## Version Selection by Use Case

| Use Case | Recommended Version | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| New web app | 3.11 or 3.12 | Performance + stability + ecosystem support |
| ML/Data science | 3.11 or 3.12 | PyTorch/TensorFlow support, performance |
| Scripts/automation | 3.10+ | Available on most systems |
| Legacy system maintenance | 3.9 (minimum) | Last version supporting some older libraries |
| Research/experimentation | 3.13 | Test cutting-edge features (no-GIL, JIT) |
| Docker containers | 3.11 or 3.12 | Official images, wide support |

## Support Timeline Summary

| Version | Released | Active Support Ends | Security Support Ends | Status |
|---------|----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------|
| 3.9 | Oct 2020 | May 2022 | **Oct 2025** | ⚠️ EOL Soon |
| 3.10 | Oct 2021 | Apr 2023 | Oct 2026 | Security only |
| 3.11 | Oct 2022 | Apr 2024 | Oct 2027 | Security only |
| 3.12 | Oct 2023 | Apr 2025 | Oct 2028 | Security only |
| 3.13 | Oct 2024 | Oct 2026 | Oct 2029 | ✅ Active |

**Planning Tip**: Always target a version with at least 2-3 years of security support remaining for new production deployments.
