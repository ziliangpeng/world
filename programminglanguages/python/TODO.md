# Python Documentation TODO

## Release Timeline

- [ ] Further refine the dates of each Python release
  - Many 0.9.x releases only have month/year or season (e.g., "Autumn 1991")
  - Some releases may have exact dates in Usenet archives or git history
  - Cross-reference with python.org release pages, PEPs, and historical sources
  - Recover timeline in a visual graph showing:
    - Development milestones
    - Release frequency over time
    - Major vs minor releases
    - Support lifecycle periods

## Additional Documentation Tasks

- [ ] Extract and format features from Python 1.x LaTeX documentation
- [ ] Create summary comparison of features across Python 0.9.x versions
- [ ] Document the transition from Python 1.6 to 2.0 (version jump)
- [ ] Add information about Python 1.5.x minor releases (1.5.1, 1.5.2)
