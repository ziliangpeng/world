## Python 3.0 (2008-2009)

**Python 3.0** - December 3, 2008 | **EOL: June 27, 2009**

Python 3.0 "Py3K" is the first ever intentionally backwards incompatible Python release - a comprehensive language redesign that fundamentally restructures Python around clean text/bytes separation, removes accumulated legacy features, and establishes a solid foundation for the language's future.

**Major Highlights:**
- `print()` as a function (not statement) with keyword arguments for flexibility
- Text vs. bytes separation - all text is Unicode (`str`), binary data is `bytes`, no implicit mixing
- Views and iterators everywhere - `dict.keys()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `range()`, `zip()` return views/iterators, not lists
- Integer division returns float - `1/2` â†’ `0.5`, use `1//2` for floor division
- Integers unified - only `int` type with unlimited precision, `long` removed
- Strict ordering comparisons - `1 < ''` raises TypeError instead of arbitrary ordering
- Classic classes removed - all classes are new-style by default

```python
# Print as function with keyword arguments
print("There are <", 2**32, "> possibilities!", sep="")

# Text vs. binary data
s = "hello"           # str type (Unicode)
b = b"hello"          # bytes type
s.encode('utf-8')     # Returns bytes
b.decode('utf-8')     # Returns str

# Extended iterable unpacking
a, *rest = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # a = 1, rest = [2, 3, 4]
```

## Python 3.1 (2009-2012)

Python 3.1 made Python 3 practical for real-world use with critical performance fixes that addressed Python 3.0's biggest bottleneck - the I/O library was completely rewritten in C for 2-20x speedup.

**Major Highlights:**
- I/O library rewritten in C (PEP 3116) - 2-20x faster I/O operations
- `OrderedDict` (PEP 372) - dictionary that preserves insertion order

- unittest improvements - test skipping, expected failures, and context manager assertions
- `importlib` module - pure Python reference implementation of import machinery

    case (x, 0):
        print(f"X-axis at {x}")
    case (x, y):
        print(f"Point at ({x}, {y}")

# Union type operator
def square(number: int | float) -> int | float:
    return number ** 2

# Better error messages
>>> collections.namedtoplo
AttributeError: module 'collections' has no attribute 'namedtoplo'.
Did you mean: 'namedtuple'?

    pass
except* ValueError as eg:
    # Handle group of ValueErrors
    pass
except* KeyError as eg:
    # Handle group of KeyErrors
    pass

# Fine-grained error locations
d = {"a": {"b": 1}}

>>> sys._is_gil_enabled()
True
```
