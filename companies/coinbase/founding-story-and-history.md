# Coinbase: Founding Story and Company History

## Executive Summary

Coinbase was founded in June 2012 by Brian Armstrong (former Airbnb engineer) and Fred Ehrsam (former Goldman Sachs trader) when Bitcoin was worth just $6. Starting from a two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco with $150,000 from Y Combinator, they built the first mainstream Bitcoin exchange in the US. The company went public via direct listing on April 14, 2021, at an $87B valuation, becoming the first major US crypto exchange to IPO. Coinbase has survived multiple crypto winters, regulatory battles, and a 38% workforce reduction, evolving from a simple Bitcoin wallet to a diversified crypto infrastructure company.

**Key Milestones:**

- 2012: Founded with $600K seed round
- 2013: Andreessen Horowitz invests $25M

## The Founding Story (2012)

### Brian Armstrong's Bitcoin Awakening

**Background:**

In 2011, Brian Armstrong was working as a software engineer at Airbnb, where he was exposed to payment systems across 190 countries. He saw firsthand the friction, fees, and barriers in the global financial system.

**The Bitcoin Moment:**

Armstrong discovered Bitcoin's whitepaper and became obsessed with its potential to create an open financial system accessible to anyone. At the time, **Bitcoin was worth $6** and "only known by a few nerds on the internet."

**Building on nights and weekends:**

While still at Airbnb, Armstrong started coding a Bitcoin wallet prototype in his spare time. He believed the biggest barrier to Bitcoin adoption was usability—buying and storing Bitcoin was too technical for normal people.

### Finding a Co-Founder on Reddit

**The Y Combinator Deadline:**

Armstrong applied to Y Combinator's Summer 2012 batch but was told he needed a co-founder to proceed. **He had only 3 days to find one.**

**The viral post:**

Armstrong posted on Hacker News explaining his mission to make Bitcoin accessible to everyone. The post went viral and spread to Reddit's r/Bitcoin community.

**Fred Ehrsam responds:**

Fred Ehrsam, a foreign exchange trader at Goldman Sachs in New York City, saw Armstrong's post on Reddit. Ehrsam had also become fascinated with Bitcoin and its potential to disrupt traditional finance.

**50+ meetings:**

Armstrong later revealed he did over 50 meetings to find the perfect co-founder before choosing Ehrsam. They bonded over their shared bullish view on Bitcoin and complementary skills:

- **Armstrong:** Technical expertise, product vision, engineering
- **Ehrsam:** Financial markets, trading, institutional relationships

### Y Combinator Summer 2012

**The acceptance:**

With Ehrsam as co-founder, they were accepted into Y Combinator's Summer 2012 batch.

**Funding:**

- Y Combinator: $150,000
- Total seed round: $600,000

**Company name:**

Originally called "Bitbank," they later changed the name to "Coinbase."

**The setup:**

They launched the company out of a **two-bedroom shared apartment** in San Francisco. This was peak scrappy startup mode.

---

## The First Product: Finding Product-Market Fit

### Version 1: The Hosted Bitcoin Wallet (Failed)

**What they built:**

Armstrong posted a simple Bitcoin wallet to Reddit. Users could create an account and store their Bitcoin securely (Coinbase held the private keys).

**The problem:**

People signed up out of curiosity, but **nobody stuck around**. There was no compelling reason to use a hosted wallet when you could run your own Bitcoin node.

### Version 2: The Buy Button (Product-Market Fit!)

**The breakthrough:**

In **October 2012**, they added a simple "buy button" that let users:

1. Connect their bank account
2. Buy Bitcoin with a bank transfer
3. Store it in their Coinbase wallet

**Instant traction:**

The minute they launched the buy button, **it started growing every day organically with zero marketing**. This was the product-market fit moment Armstrong had been waiting for.

**Why it worked:**

Before Coinbase, buying Bitcoin required:

- Wiring money to sketchy exchanges (Mt. Gox in Japan)
- Meeting strangers in person with cash (LocalBitcoins)
- Mining it yourself

Coinbase made it as easy as buying a book on Amazon.

### Early Growth Hacks

**1. Free Bitcoin for feedback (Reddit):**

Armstrong offered **0.10 BTC** to users who emailed in feedback on the product. He posted this offer on Reddit's r/Bitcoin.

**2. Cold emails with free Bitcoin:**

The team sent cold emails to potential users with **0.05 BTC** attached. All you had to do was create a Coinbase account to claim it.

**3. Word of mouth:**

The product was so much easier than alternatives that users naturally told their friends.

### Explosive Early Traction

**August 2012:**

- Signups increased **20% daily** (week of Aug 10-17)
- Compounding growth with no paid marketing

**9 months after Y Combinator demo day:**

- **109,000 users**
- **107,000 transactions per month**
- Users moving "$130-odd bitcoins" each

**First year (by October 2013):**

- **650,000+ retail users**
- **$1 million in Bitcoin** bought/sold per month
- Fastest-growing Y Combinator company to date

---

## Major Funding Rounds and Valuation Growth

### 2013: Andreessen Horowitz ($25M Series B)

**The validation:**

Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of Silicon Valley's most prestigious VCs, invested **$25 million** in Coinbase.

**Why this mattered:**

- First major institutional validation of Bitcoin
- a16z's Marc Andreessen became vocal Bitcoin advocate
- Gave Coinbase credibility with regulators and banks

### 2018: Series E ($300M at $8B valuation)

**The scale:**

By 2018, Coinbase raised **$300 million** at an **$8 billion valuation**.

**Total capital raised by 2021:**

- 12 funding rounds
- $547 million total raised
- Investors: a16z, Union Square Ventures, Ribbit Capital, Y Combinator

---

## Pre-IPO Growth (2020-2021)

### 2020: The Setup Year

**Metrics:**

- Revenue: **$1.14 billion** (up from $483M in 2019)
- Users: **43 million verified**
- Institutions: **7,000** institutional clients
- Ecosystem: **115,000 partners** in 100+ countries

**Strategic move:**

In mid-December 2020, Coinbase announced filing an **S-1 IPO with the SEC**.

### Q1 2021: The Pre-IPO Blowout Quarter

**Revenue explosion:**

- Revenue: **$1.8 billion** (9x increase from $90.6M prior year)
- Profit: **$730-800 million** (up from $32M prior year)

**Why the surge:**

- Bitcoin rallied from $29K (Jan 2021) to $60K (March 2021)
- Institutional adoption accelerating
- Retail FOMO (fear of missing out)
- Coinbase was the easiest onramp

---

## The Historic IPO (April 14, 2021)

### The Direct Listing Approach

**Structure:**

Coinbase chose a **direct listing** (like Spotify, Slack) instead of a traditional IPO:

- No new shares issued
- No underwriters
- Existing shareholders sell directly to public
- More transparent price discovery

### IPO Day: April 14, 2021

**Reference price:** $250 per share

Set by Nasdaq as a starting point based on private market trades.

**First trade:** $381 per share (+52% above reference)

**Intraday high:** $429.54 (+72% above reference)

**Closing price:** $328.28 (+31.3% above reference)

**Market capitalization at close:** $87.3 billion

**Peak valuation (intraday):** Briefly hit **$100 billion**

### The Significance

**Historic moment:**

Coinbase became the **first major US cryptocurrency exchange to go public** on a US stock exchange.

**Legitimacy signal:**

The IPO was seen as validation that crypto had arrived in mainstream finance. A regulated, compliant crypto company was now trading on Nasdaq alongside Apple, Amazon, and Google.

**Media coverage:**

Described as "the biggest IPO in history" by some outlets (hyperbole, but massive coverage).

### Post-IPO Funding

**May 2021:**

Raised **$1.25 billion** in a post-IPO funding round, bringing additional capital for expansion.

## Major Controversies and Challenges

### 2017: Bitcoin Cash (BCash) Insider Trading Scandal

**What happened:**

On December 19, 2017, Coinbase suddenly announced support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a controversial Bitcoin fork.

**The suspicious activity:**

- BCH price jumped **130%** in the days around the announcement
- Dec 18: $1,865
- Feb 20: $4,300 (peak)
- Trading volume spiked before the announcement

**The allegations:**

A user filed a **class action lawsuit** claiming:

- Coinbase employees knew about the BCH listing in advance
- Insiders bought BCH before the public announcement
- This created "artificially inflated prices"
- Coinbase disclosed buy/sell orders moments after launching BCH support

**Coinbase's response:**

- Froze BCH trading temporarily
- Launched internal investigation
- Unsurprisingly, "found no wrongdoing"

**Outcome:**

- The class action lawsuit was **dismissed** by a US District Judge
- Reputation damage remained
- Raised questions about Coinbase's internal controls

**Later development:**

In 2022, a **former Coinbase product manager** (Ishan Wahi) pleaded guilty to the **first-ever cryptocurrency insider trading case**, unrelated to BCH but showing insider trading was indeed happening at Coinbase.

### 2017-2019: IRS Battle Over User Data

**The IRS demand:**

In 2017, the IRS demanded Coinbase turn over records of **all users** to identify tax evaders.

**The context:**

Only **802 people** reported Bitcoin gains to the IRS in 2015, despite millions trading crypto. The IRS suspected massive tax evasion.

**Coinbase's resistance:**

Coinbase fought the request, arguing it was:

- Overly broad (violated user privacy)
- Unconstitutional search and seizure
- Most users weren't evading taxes

**The settlement (Feb 2018):**

Coinbase agreed to turn over data on **13,000 "high-transacting" customers**:

- Users who bought, sold, sent, or received $20,000+ in any year (2013-2015)
- Included names, addresses, taxpayer IDs, transaction history

**The fallout:**

In **August 2019**, 10,000+ cryptocurrency holders received "crypto letters" from the IRS informing them the agency had obtained their Coinbase financial records.

**User backlash:**

Many users felt betrayed that Coinbase handed over their data, even though Coinbase fought to minimize the disclosure.

---

## The Crypto Winter Crisis (2022-2023)

### Market Context

**The crash:**

- Bitcoin peaked at **$69,000** in November 2021
- By June 2022: Bitcoin dropped to **$20,000** (-71%)
- Crypto market cap fell below **$1 trillion** (down from $3T)
- **12 straight weeks of losses**
- Luna/Terra collapse, Three Arrows Capital bankruptcy, Celsius freeze

### First Layoffs: June 2022

**The announcement:**

CEO Brian Armstrong announced Coinbase would lay off **1,100 employees** (**18% of workforce**) in a blog post.

**Armstrong's reasoning:**

- "Preparing for a recession and potential crypto winter"
- Admitted Coinbase **"grew too quickly"** during the bull market
- Over-hired in anticipation of continued growth
- Need to "ensure we can weather downturns in the crypto market"

**The optics:**

Coinbase was one of the **first major crypto companies to announce layoffs**, which damaged morale across the industry.

### Second Wave: January 2023

**The deeper cuts:**

Just 7 months later, Coinbase announced a **second round of layoffs**:

- **950 employees** cut (**20% of remaining workforce**)
- Goal: Reduce operating costs by **25%**

**Total damage:**

- Combined layoffs: **~2,050 employees**
- **38% reduction** from peak headcount
- 26,000+ jobs lost across entire crypto industry in 2022

**The admission:**

Armstrong admitted in a blog post:

> "We grew our expenses too quickly. We over-hired."

**Employee impact:**

- Severance packages offered
- Public companies like Coinbase are under intense scrutiny during layoffs
- Damaged employer brand

### Financial Impact (2022)

**Q3 2022 (worst quarter):**

- Revenue: **$590M** (down 55% YoY)
- Net Income: **-$545M** (loss)
- Trading volume collapsed

**Full Year 2022:**

- Revenue: **$3.2B** (down 57% from 2021's $7.4B)
- Net Income: **-$2.6B** (massive loss)
- Net margin: **-81%**

## Strategic Pivot: Base Blockchain (2023)

### The Announcement (February 2023)

**The vision:**

In the depths of crypto winter, Coinbase announced **Base**: an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain.

**Mission statement:**

> "Bring the next billion users onchain"

**Strategic rationale:**

- Diversify beyond just being an exchange
- Build infrastructure for the crypto economy
- Generate new revenue streams (sequencer fees, transaction fees)
- Compete with layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon

### Technology Foundation

**Built on OP Stack:**

Base is built on the **OP Stack** (open-source code from Optimism), an MIT-licensed framework for Ethereum Layer 2s.

**Partnership with Optimism:**

- Collaboration with Optimism team
- Share technology and governance
- Part of "Superchain" vision (network of interoperable L2s)

**Technical specs:**

- Ethereum Layer 2 (inherits Ethereum security)
- Low-cost transactions (~$0.01 vs Ethereum's $1-50)
- Fast confirmations (~2 seconds)
- EVM-compatible (all Ethereum apps work on Base)

### Mainnet Launch: August 9, 2023

**Public launch:**

After a "builder-only" phase in July, Base opened to the public on **August 9, 2023**.

**Historic milestone:**

Base became the **first blockchain launched by a publicly-traded company** (Coinbase is traded on Nasdaq).

### Strategic Advantages

**1. Integrated with Coinbase ecosystem:**

- **110 million verified Coinbase users** can easily bridge to Base
- **$80 billion in assets** on Coinbase platform
- Built-in fiat onramps (buy crypto with credit card, bank transfer)
- One-click bridge from Coinbase to Base

**2. No separate Base token:**

Unlike most L2s, Base has **no native token**. It uses **ETH** for gas fees.

**Why this matters:**

- No regulatory risk of Base token being classified as a security
- Simpler for users (don't need to buy a new token)
- Aligns with Ethereum ecosystem

**3. Ecosystem fund:**

Coinbase Ventures launched an **ecosystem fund** to make pre-seed investments in projects building on Base.

### "Onchain Summer" Campaign

**The marketing push:**

Base launched "Onchain Summer" in August 2023 to reframe crypto as "fun and engaging" rather than speculative.

**Brand partnerships:**

- **Coca-Cola**
- **Atari**
- 50+ other consumer brands, platforms, creators

**Goal:**

Make crypto accessible and fun for mainstream consumers, not just crypto natives.

## Cultural Moments and Philosophy

### "Mission-Focused" Culture

**Armstrong's 2020 blog post:**

In September 2020, Armstrong published a controversial blog post titled "Coinbase is a mission-focused company."

**Key points:**

- Employees should focus on crypto mission, not political activism
- Coinbase won't take stances on social/political issues unrelated to crypto
- Offered generous severance to employees who disagreed (60 took it)

**Reaction:**

- Praised by some as "focus on the mission"
- Criticized by others as "tone-deaf" during social justice movements
- Set Coinbase apart from other tech companies

### Regulatory Philosophy

**Compliance-first approach:**

Unlike many crypto companies, Coinbase has always prioritized:

- US regulatory compliance
- Banking partnerships
- Licensing in all 50 states
- Working with regulators, not against them

**The bet:**

Armstrong believed the compliant, regulated crypto company would win long-term, even if it meant slower growth short-term.

**The payoff:**

This approach enabled Coinbase to:

- Go public on Nasdaq
- Work with institutional clients
- Survive regulatory crackdowns that killed competitors

## The Transformation: 2012 vs 2025

### 2012: Two Guys in an Apartment

- Team: 2 founders
- Product: Simple Bitcoin wallet + buy button
- Users: 0 → 109,000 in 9 months
- Revenue: ~$0
- Bitcoin price: $6
- Valuation: $600K seed round

### 2025: Crypto Infrastructure Giant

- Team: ~5,000 employees (after 38% reduction)
- Products: Exchange, custody, staking, NFTs, blockchain (Base), card, wallet
- Users: 100M+ verified accounts
- Revenue: ~$1.9B per quarter
- Bitcoin price: $89K
- Market cap: ~$74B

**Revenue breakdown (Q3 2025):**

- Transaction revenue: $1,000M (53%)
- Subscription & services: $747M (39%)
  - Stablecoin revenue: $355M
  - Staking: $185M
  - Other: $207M
- Other: $153M (8%)

### The Journey

From **"making Bitcoin easy to use"** (2012) to **"bringing the next billion users onchain"** (2025).

Coinbase survived:

- Mt. Gox collapse (2014)
- ICO bubble and bust (2017-2018)
- Crypto winter (2018-2019)
- Pandemic volatility (2020)
- Bull market euphoria (2021)
- Catastrophic crash (2022)
- Regulatory uncertainty (ongoing)

**The survivors' advantage:**

Coinbase is one of the few crypto companies from 2012 still operating. Competitors died (Mt. Gox, QuadrigaCX), merged (Kraken acquired competitors), or stayed private.

---

## Lessons from the Coinbase Story

### 1. Product-Market Fit is Obvious

The difference between the wallet (nobody used it) and the buy button (organic viral growth) was night and day. When you have product-market fit, you know.

### 2. Regulation Can Be a Moat

Coinbase's compliance-first approach was slower and more expensive, but it created a regulatory moat that killed less compliant competitors.

### 3. Diversification Matters

Coinbase started as a Bitcoin exchange. By 2025, only 21% of revenue comes from trading. Stablecoins (19%), staking (10%), and other services (39%) diversified revenue.

### 4. Crypto is Cyclical

Coinbase's revenue swung from $2.49B (Q4 2021) to $590M (Q3 2022)—a **4.2x range**. You must survive winters to enjoy summers.

### 5. Mission-Driven Founders Last

Brian Armstrong is still CEO after 13 years, rare in tech. Mission-focused founders who believe in the long-term vision weather volatility better than mercenaries.

### 6. Public Markets Demand Discipline

Going public forced Coinbase to manage costs, diversify revenue, and operate profitably. Private crypto companies can burn cash indefinitely; public companies can't.
