# Coinbase: Business Model and Revenue Streams

## Executive Summary

Coinbase is fundamentally a **crypto trading platform** that makes money from transaction fees, but it's rapidly transforming into a diversified financial services company. Unlike Circle (which earns 96% from reserve interest), Coinbase has successfully diversified its revenue streams.

**Key Numbers (Q3 2025):**

- Total Revenue: $1.9B
- Transaction Revenue: $1.0B (53%)
- Subscription & Services: $747M (47%)
- Net Income: $433M
- Adjusted EBITDA: $801M

**The Big Shift:** In 2020, 96% of revenue came from trading fees. By Q3 2025, it's down to 53%. Coinbase is deliberately moving from cyclical trading revenue to stable, recurring subscription revenue.

## The Core Business: Crypto Trading Platform

### What Coinbase Does (Simple Version)

1. **You deposit money** (USD, EUR, etc.) into Coinbase
2. **You trade crypto** (buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.)
3. **Coinbase charges you fees** for each trade
4. **You can hold crypto** on the platform or withdraw to your own wallet

**The flywheel:**
- More users → More trading volume → More fees
- But when crypto crashes → Trading volume dies → Revenue collapses

**This is why Coinbase is diversifying aggressively.**

---

## Revenue Stream #1: Transaction Fees ($1.0B, 53% of revenue)

### How It Works

Coinbase charges fees when you buy or sell cryptocurrency.

**Two customer segments:**

1. **Consumer (Retail):** You and I trading on the Coinbase app
2. **Institutional:** Hedge funds, corporations, trading firms

### Consumer Transaction Fees: $844M

**Standard Coinbase App:**

- **Spread:** 0.50% on every transaction
- **Plus flat fee:**
  - $0-10: $0.99 fee
  - $10-25: $1.49 fee
  - $25-50: $1.99 fee
  - $50-200: $2.99 fee
  - $200+: 1.49% fee

**Example:**
- Buy $100 of Bitcoin
- Pay: 0.50% spread ($0.50) + $2.99 flat fee = **$3.49 total (3.49%)**
- This is VERY expensive compared to other exchanges

**Coinbase Advanced Trade (lower fees):**

Uses "maker-taker" model:
- **Maker** (add liquidity): 0.00%-0.40%
- **Taker** (take liquidity): 0.05%-0.60%
- Fee tier based on 30-day volume

| 30-Day Volume | Maker Fee | Taker Fee |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| <$10K | 0.40% | 0.60% |
| $10K-$50K | 0.25% | 0.40% |
| $50K-$100K | 0.15% | 0.25% |
| $1M-$10M | 0.04% | 0.06% |
| $100M+ | 0.00% | 0.05% |

**Debit/Credit Card Buys:**
- Fee: **3.99%** (extremely expensive)
- Used for instant purchases
- Most retail users do this initially

**Why this is profitable:**
- Gross margin: ~85-90% (very little cost to execute trades)
- Highly scalable (software-based)

**Why this is risky:**
- **Ultra-cyclical:** Dependent on crypto price volatility
- When crypto is boring → People don't trade → Revenue dies
- 2021 (bull market): $7.8B transaction revenue
- 2023 (bear market): $2.1B transaction revenue (-73%!)

### Institutional Transaction Fees: $135M

**How it works:**

Enterprises and professional traders use Coinbase Prime, Coinbase Exchange, or Derivatives:

- **Much lower fees:** 0.01%-0.20% (vs 1-4% retail)
- **Higher volumes:** Billions in trading per client
- **Derivatives:** Through Deribit acquisition

**Recent growth:**
- Q2 2025: $61M
- Q3 2025: $135M (+122% quarter-over-quarter!)

**Why institutions use Coinbase:**
- Regulated and licensed in U.S.
- Best security and custody
- Compliance infrastructure
- Liquidity (can execute large orders)

**The trade-off:**
- Lower fees but massive volume
- Less profitable per trade, but more stable
- Institutions trade even in bear markets (hedging, arbitrage)

---

## Revenue Stream #2: Stablecoin Revenue ($355M, 19% of revenue)

### This is Where Coinbase and Circle's Stories Intersect

**Background:**
- Coinbase co-founded USDC with Circle in 2018
- Created "Centre Consortium" to govern USDC
- In 2023, Circle took full control of USDC
- BUT Coinbase retained lucrative revenue-sharing deal

### How Coinbase Makes Money from USDC

**Two mechanisms:**

#### 1. Revenue Share with Circle (50/50 split)

- Circle earns interest on USDC reserves (invested in Treasuries at ~4-5%)
- This interest is **split 50/50** between Circle and Coinbase
- Example:
  - $70B USDC in circulation
  - Earning 4.5% interest = $3.15B annually
  - Circle gets: $1.575B
  - Coinbase gets: $1.575B

**Wait, but Coinbase only reported $355M in stablecoin revenue?**

That's because most USDC is held OFF Coinbase's platform (in wallets, DeFi, other exchanges).

#### 2. Interest on USDC Held ON Coinbase (100% to Coinbase)

- USDC held directly on Coinbase's platform
- Coinbase earns **100% of the interest** (no split with Circle)
- Users get $0 in interest (same as Circle's USDC model)

**The math:**
- Estimated ~$10B USDC on Coinbase platform
- At 4.5% interest: ~$450M annual revenue
- Coinbase keeps 100%

**Why this is brilliant:**

1. **Not dependent on trading volume** - Earns even in crypto winter
2. **Scales with USDC adoption** - More USDC = more interest
3. **Zero marginal cost** - No overhead to earn this revenue
4. **Recurring** - Interest accrues daily, predictably

**Why this is growing fast:**
- Q3 2024: $247M
- Q3 2025: $355M (+44% year-over-year)
- As interest rates were high (5%+), this revenue exploded
- Even as rates decline to 3-4%, still substantial

**The risk:**
- Declining interest rates (Fed cutting)
- USDC losing market share to Tether
- Circle potentially renegotiating revenue share

---

## Revenue Stream #3: Blockchain Rewards (Staking) ($185M, 10% of revenue)

### How Staking Works

**What is staking?**

Some cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Solana, Cardano) use "Proof of Stake":
- You "stake" (lock up) your coins to help secure the network
- In return, you earn rewards (like interest)
- Example: Stake 10 ETH, earn ~4% annual rewards = 0.4 ETH per year

**Coinbase's role:**

Coinbase runs the staking infrastructure (validators, servers, etc.) for users:
- User holds ETH on Coinbase
- Coinbase stakes it on user's behalf
- Rewards are earned
- **Coinbase takes 25% commission**

**The math:**

- User earns: 4% staking rewards
- Coinbase takes: 25% of rewards = 1%
- User nets: 3%

**Example:**
- User stakes $100,000 in ETH
- Annual rewards at 4%: $4,000
- Coinbase commission (25%): **$1,000**
- User receives: $3,000

### Why This is a Great Business

**1. Recurring revenue:**
- Rewards accrue continuously
- Users tend to keep coins staked long-term
- Not dependent on trading volume

**2. High margin:**
- Software-based infrastructure
- Scales well (same infrastructure for 10 users or 10M users)
- Estimated gross margin: 70-80%

**3. Growing market:**
- Ethereum moved to Proof of Stake in 2022 (huge catalyst)
- Solana, Cardano, Polkadot all use staking
- More assets adding staking over time

**4. Sticky:**
- Once users start staking, they rarely stop
- Compounding rewards incentivize long-term holding

### Current Scale

**Q3 2025: $185M in staking revenue**

Breakdown (estimated):
- Ethereum staking: ~$120M (65%)
- Solana staking: ~$40M (22%)
- Other (Cardano, Polkadot, etc.): ~$25M (13%)

**Growth:**
- Q2 2025: $145M
- Q3 2025: $185M (+28% quarter-over-quarter)
- Driven by ETH and SOL price increases + more adoption

**Assets staked on Coinbase (estimated):**
- ~$25-30B worth of crypto currently staked
- At ~3% average commission rate = $750M-900M annual run rate potential

### The Regulatory Risk

**SEC's position:**
- SEC sued Coinbase in 2023, claiming staking is an unregistered security
- Case is ongoing as of 2025
- If SEC wins, Coinbase may have to shut down staking in U.S.
- This would eliminate $185M/quarter ($740M annual) revenue

**Coinbase's defense:**
- Staking is not a security (just a service)
- Similar to earning interest in a bank account
- Established practice in crypto for years

**The outcome will materially impact Coinbase's revenue.**

---

## Revenue Stream #4: Custody Fees ($143M, 8% of revenue)

### What is Custody?

**Traditional definition:**
- Institutions (hedge funds, ETFs, corporations) need secure storage for crypto
- Coinbase provides vault services, insurance, compliance
- Charges fees based on assets under custody (AUM)

**Why institutions need custody:**
- Can't just use a hardware wallet (compliance, insurance, auditing requirements)
- Need institutional-grade security
- Multi-signature controls, disaster recovery, etc.

### The Bitcoin ETF Goldmine

**January 2024: Bitcoin ETFs approved by SEC**

11 Bitcoin ETFs launched, including:
- BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)
- Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC)
- Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)
- Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)

**Coinbase's dominance:**
- Selected as custodian for **8 of 11 Bitcoin ETFs**
- Market share: ~90% of Bitcoin ETF assets
- Current AUM: ~$100 billion+ in Bitcoin ETFs alone

**Custody fee structure:**
- Standard fee: **0.15-0.25% annually** on AUM
- For Bitcoin ETFs specifically: ~0.20% average

**The revenue math:**

- $100B in Bitcoin ETF custody
- At 0.20% annual fee
- **$200M annual revenue** from Bitcoin ETFs alone

But Q3 2025 showed only $143M in total custody revenue. Why?

**Revenue recognition:**
- Some fees shared with ETF issuers
- Volume discounts for largest clients
- Custody fees accrued quarterly, not all upfront

**Still, this is massive recurring revenue.**

### Beyond Bitcoin ETFs

Coinbase also provides custody for:
- Hedge funds' crypto holdings
- Corporate treasuries (MicroStrategy, Tesla)
- Ethereum ETFs (launched in 2024)
- International institutions

**Total assets under custody (estimated): $150-200B**

**Why Coinbase wins custody deals:**

1. **Regulatory compliance:** Fully licensed in U.S.
2. **Security track record:** No major hacks (unlike competitors)
3. **Insurance:** $320M+ in insurance coverage
4. **Brand trust:** Publicly-traded, audited
5. **First-mover:** Built custody infrastructure early

### The Stickiness Factor

**Once institutions pick a custodian, they rarely switch:**

- Migration is painful (technical, legal, compliance)
- Regulatory approval required
- Risk of errors during transfer
- Existing integrations and workflows

**This makes custody revenue extremely stable and recurring.**

**Growth potential:**
- More Bitcoin ETF inflows ($100B → $500B possible)
- Ethereum ETF adoption
- Corporate adoption (more companies buying Bitcoin)
- International expansion

---

## Revenue Stream #5: Interest Income ($65M, 3% of revenue)

### How It Works

**Customer fiat balances:**

When you deposit USD into Coinbase:
- It sits in your Coinbase account
- Coinbase holds it (not you)
- You earn: **$0 in interest**
- Coinbase invests it in short-term Treasuries earning ~4-5%
- Coinbase keeps: **100% of the yield**

**Sound familiar? This is exactly Circle's model.**

**The math:**

- Estimated $15-20B in customer fiat balances on Coinbase
- Earning ~4.5% interest
- Annual interest income: $675M-900M potential

But Q3 2025 showed only $65M. Why so low?

**Reasons:**

1. **Most customers hold crypto, not fiat** - Only a small % keep USD sitting
2. **Regulatory restrictions** - Some jurisdictions limit what Coinbase can invest in
3. **Customer withdrawals** - Fiat needs to be liquid for withdrawals

**Still, this is pure profit with zero marginal cost.**

### Institutional Loans

Coinbase also earns interest from:
- **Margin loans** to institutional traders
- **Securities lending** (lending crypto to short sellers)
- **Stablecoin-backed loans**

**Interest rates charged:**
- Margin loans: 5-12% annual
- Securities lending: Variable based on demand

**This is growing but still small (~$10-20M/quarter).**

---

## Revenue Stream #6: Other Services ($143M, 8% of revenue)

This is a catch-all category including:

### Coinbase One Subscription ($5-10M/month)

**What it is:**
- $29.99/month subscription
- Perks:
  - $0 trading fees (on up to $10K/month volume)
  - Rewards on purchases
  - Priority customer support

**Why it exists:**
- Compete with Robinhood (zero-fee trading)
- Lock in loyal customers
- Recurring revenue

**Current scale:**
- ~500K-1M subscribers (estimated)
- $15-30M monthly revenue
- Growing slowly

### Earn Campaigns

**How it works:**
- Users watch educational videos about crypto projects
- Get paid in that project's cryptocurrency
- Example: Watch 5 videos about Solana, earn $5 in SOL

**Revenue model:**
- Crypto projects PAY Coinbase to run these campaigns
- It's marketing for the crypto projects
- Coinbase takes a % of the campaign budget

**Scale:** ~$5-10M/quarter

### Developer Platform (Coinbase Cloud, Base)

**Coinbase Base:**
- Coinbase launched its own Layer 2 blockchain in 2023
- Built on Ethereum
- Earns fees from transactions on Base

**Coinbase Cloud:**
- APIs for developers to integrate crypto
- Node infrastructure
- Data analytics

**Combined revenue:** ~$20-40M/quarter (growing fast)

### Institutional Services

- Prime brokerage services
- OTC (over-the-counter) trading desk
- Consulting for institutions entering crypto

**Revenue:** ~$30-50M/quarter

## Historical Revenue Trends: The Crypto Cycle Impact

### Revenue by Year

| Year | Total Revenue | Transaction Revenue | Subscription & Services | % Subscription |
|------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **2020** | $1.3B | $1.1B | $0.2B | 15% |
| **2021** | $7.4B | $6.9B | $0.5B | 7% |
| **2022** | $3.2B | $2.3B | $0.9B | 28% |
| **2023** | $3.1B | $1.9B | $1.2B | 39% |
| **2024** | $6.6B | $4.2B | $2.4B | 36% |
| **2025** (annualized from Q3) | $7.6B | $4.0B | $3.0B | 39% |

### What This Shows

**The pattern:**

1. **2021: Bull market peak**
   - Bitcoin: $69K peak
   - Massive retail FOMO
   - Transaction revenue exploded to $6.9B
   - Subscription revenue tiny ($500M, only 7%)

2. **2022-2023: Crypto winter**
   - Bitcoin: Crashed to $16K
   - Trading volume collapsed
   - Transaction revenue: -73% decline
   - But subscription revenue GREW (+60%)
   - This kept Coinbase alive

3. **2024-2025: Bull market return**
   - Bitcoin: Back to $90K+
   - Trading volume recovered
   - Transaction revenue rebounded
   - Subscription revenue continued growing

**Key insight: Subscription revenue is counter-cyclical or non-cyclical**

- Stablecoin revenue: Grows regardless of trading volume
- Staking revenue: Grows with crypto prices AND adoption
- Custody revenue: Grows with institutional adoption
- Interest income: Grows with interest rates

**This diversification saved Coinbase from dying in 2022-2023.**

## Profitability Analysis

### Q3 2025 Financials

**Revenue:** $1.9B

**Expenses:**

- **Transaction expense:** $111M (6% of revenue)
  - Exchange fees, network fees, processing

- **Technology and development:** $450M (24% of revenue)
  - Engineers, product development, infrastructure

- **Sales and marketing:** $220M (12% of revenue)
  - User acquisition, brand marketing

- **General and administrative:** $180M (9% of revenue)
  - Legal, compliance, corporate overhead

**Total operating expenses:** ~$961M (51% of revenue)

**Operating income:** ~$939M

**Net income:** $433M (23% net margin)

**Adjusted EBITDA:** $801M (42% EBITDA margin)

### Why Profitability is Volatile

**Highly operating-leveraged:**

- Fixed costs: ~$800M/quarter (tech, employees, compliance)
- Variable costs: Only ~$100M (transaction processing)

**What this means:**

- When revenue is high ($2B+): Very profitable (40%+ margin)
- When revenue is low (<$1B): Unprofitable (negative margin)

**Historical net income:**

- 2021: +$3.6B (49% margin) - Peak bull market
- 2022: -$2.6B (loss) - Crypto winter
- 2023: -$0.1B (barely break-even)
- 2024: +$1.7B (26% margin) - Recovery
- 2025 Q3: +$433M (23% margin)

**Coinbase swings from massively profitable to massively unprofitable based on crypto market.**

## Comparison to Competitors

### vs Binance (Largest Crypto Exchange)

| Metric | Coinbase | Binance |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Trading volume (daily)** | $5-8B | $40-80B |
| **Revenue (2024)** | $6.6B | ~$12B (estimated) |
| **Transaction fees** | 0.5-4% (retail) | 0.1-0.5% |
| **Regulation** | Fully licensed (U.S.) | Offshore, legal issues |
| **Custody** | $150-200B AUM | Limited institutional |
| **Staking** | $25-30B | $50B+ |

**Binance's advantages:**
- Much higher volume (10x Coinbase)
- Lower fees (more competitive)
- Global reach (Coinbase mostly U.S.)

**Coinbase's advantages:**
- Regulatory compliance (moat in U.S.)
- Custody dominance (institutions trust Coinbase)
- Public company (transparency, trust)

### vs Kraken

| Metric | Coinbase | Kraken |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Revenue (2024)** | $6.6B | ~$1B |
| **Users** | 108M | ~13M |
| **Fees** | Higher | Lower |
| **Custody** | Dominant | Small |

**Coinbase is 6-7x larger than Kraken.**

### vs Robinhood

| Metric | Coinbase | Robinhood |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Crypto revenue (2024)** | $6.6B | ~$500M |
| **Crypto users** | 108M | ~23M crypto users |
| **Fees** | 0.5-4% | 0% (with spreads) |

**Robinhood is a threat:**
- Zero-fee crypto trading (eats into Coinbase retail)
- But Robinhood has no custody, staking, or institutional business
- Coinbase is much more diversified

---

## The Coinbase vs Circle Comparison

### Business Model Differences

| | Coinbase | Circle |
|---|----------|--------|
| **Core business** | Crypto exchange | Stablecoin issuer |
| **Primary revenue** | Trading fees (53%) | Reserve interest (96%) |
| **Revenue (Q3 2025)** | $1.9B | $740M |
| **Diversification** | High (47% non-trading) | Low (4% non-core) |
| **Interest rate exposure** | Medium (19% from stablecoins) | Extreme (96% from reserves) |
| **Cyclicality** | Very high (tied to crypto prices) | Medium (tied to rates + USDC growth) |
| **Regulatory risk** | High (SEC lawsuits) | Medium (stablecoin regulation) |

### The USDC Connection

**Coinbase and Circle are partners AND competitors:**

**Partnership:**
- Co-founded USDC together
- 50/50 revenue share on USDC interest
- Both benefit from USDC growth

**Competition:**
- Coinbase wants USDC ON its platform (100% of interest)
- Circle wants USDC everywhere (50% of interest, but more total volume)
- Misaligned incentives

**What if they break up?**

Unlikely, but possible scenarios:

1. **Coinbase launches its own stablecoin**
   - Loses 50% revenue share
   - But gets 100% of interest
   - Regulatory risk (hard to get approved)

2. **Circle renegotiates the split**
   - Coinbase's 50% share could drop to 30-40%
   - Would hurt Coinbase revenue
   - Circle has more leverage as USDC grows

**For now, the partnership is mutually beneficial.**

---

## Key Risks and Challenges

### 1. Regulatory Risk (BIGGEST RISK)

**SEC lawsuits (ongoing):**

- Claiming Coinbase operates as unregistered securities exchange
- Claims staking is an unregistered security
- Potential outcomes:
  - Best case: Coinbase wins, gets regulatory clarity
  - Middle case: Settlement, restricted U.S. operations
  - Worst case: Forced to delist most crypto, shut down staking
  - Impact: Could eliminate 30-50% of revenue

**Stablecoin regulation:**
- New laws could restrict USDC revenue-sharing
- Could cap fees or force revenue to users
- Impact: ~$355M/quarter at risk

### 2. Crypto Price Volatility

**When crypto crashes:**
- Trading volume drops 70-80%
- Transaction revenue collapses
- Coinbase goes from profitable to unprofitable
- Stock price follows (down 80-90%)

**2022-2023 example:**
- Revenue: $7.4B → $3.1B (-58%)
- Net income: +$3.6B → -$2.6B
- Stock: $368 → $31 (-92%)

**This will happen again in next crypto winter.**

### 3. Competition

**Fee compression:**
- Robinhood, Binance, others offer lower/zero fees
- Coinbase losing retail market share
- Can't compete on price (needs revenue)

**DeFi (Decentralized Finance):**
- Users can trade directly on DEXs (Uniswap, etc.)
- No Coinbase needed
- Lower fees, more privacy
- Threat to long-term model

### 4. Custody Concentration Risk

**Bitcoin ETF custody:**
- 90% market share is great BUT
- If one major ETF switches custodians, could lose $50-100M annual revenue
- Competitors (Fidelity, Gemini) building custody
- Long-term: Market share will decline

### 5. Interest Rate Risk

**Declining rates hurt subscription revenue:**
- Stablecoin revenue tied to Treasury yields
- Interest income tied to rates
- If Fed cuts to 2%: Lose ~$150-200M annually

**This is the same risk Circle faces.**

### 6. USDC Market Share Loss

**Tether (USDT) dominance:**
- Tether: $140B circulation
- USDC: $37B circulation
- If USDC loses share: Coinbase loses 50% of that interest income

**New stablecoin competitors:**
- PayPal USD (PYUSD)
- Others launching stablecoins
- Could fragment market

---

## Growth Opportunities

### 1. International Expansion

**Current state:**
- ~80% of revenue from U.S.
- Huge untapped markets: Europe, Asia, LatAm

**Strategy:**
- Licenses in EU, UK, Singapore, etc.
- Localized products
- Partnerships with local banks

**Potential:** 2-3x user base, +$2-4B revenue

### 2. Institutional Adoption

**Current state:**
- ~$200M/quarter from institutional custody
- Only ~10% of institutional investors have crypto exposure

**Catalysts:**
- More Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs
- Pension funds entering crypto
- Corporate treasuries buying Bitcoin

**Potential:** 5-10x custody AUM, +$500M-1B annual revenue

### 3. Layer 2 (Base Blockchain)

**What is Base:**
- Coinbase's own blockchain (launched 2023)
- Built on Ethereum (Layer 2 for lower fees)
- Earns fees from every transaction

**Current scale:**
- ~$5-10M/quarter revenue
- But growing 100%+ quarter-over-quarter

**Potential:**
- If Base becomes top-3 L2: +$200-500M annual revenue
- Developer ecosystem, DeFi apps, etc.

### 4. Coinbase One (Subscription)

**Current state:**
- ~$30M/month ($120M/quarter)
- 500K-1M subscribers

**Growth strategy:**
- Add more perks (higher staking yields, exclusive access)
- Bundle with other Coinbase services
- Target active traders

**Potential:** 5M subscribers = $150M/month ($600M/quarter)

### 5. Staking Expansion

**Current state:**
- $185M/quarter from staking
- Only ETH, SOL, ADA, etc.

**Opportunities:**
- More assets moving to Proof of Stake
- Liquid staking (users can stake + still trade)
- Institutional staking (pensions, endowments)

**Potential:** 3-5x current revenue = $555M-925M/quarter

---

## Investment Thesis Implications

### Bull Case for Coinbase

**Coinbase is attractive if:**

1. **Crypto bull market continues** (Bitcoin to $150K+)
   - Trading volume surges
   - Transaction revenue explodes
   - Profitability scales rapidly

2. **Subscription revenue keeps growing** (to 60%+ of total)
   - Becomes less cyclical
   - More stable, predictable
   - Higher valuation multiple

3. **Regulatory clarity** (Coinbase wins SEC case)
   - Can operate freely
   - Expands product offerings
   - Institutional confidence grows

4. **International expansion succeeds**
   - 2-3x user base
   - Diversifies away from U.S. risk
   - Revenue doubles

**Outcome:** Stock to $400-500 (2-2.5x from current ~$200)

### Bear Case for Coinbase

**Coinbase is unattractive if:**

1. **Crypto winter returns** (Bitcoin to $30K)
   - Trading volume collapses 70%+
   - Transaction revenue crashes
   - Company unprofitable

2. **SEC wins lawsuit**
   - Forced to delist most crypto
   - Shut down staking ($740M annual revenue lost)
   - Limited to Bitcoin/Ethereum only

3. **Fee compression accelerates**
   - Robinhood, others take market share
   - Coinbase forced to cut fees
   - Revenue declines even with flat volume

4. **Interest rates drop to 2%**
   - Stablecoin revenue halves
   - Interest income disappears
   - Subscription revenue growth stalls

**Outcome:** Stock to $50-80 (-60-75% from current)

### Base Case

**Most likely scenario:**

- Crypto remains volatile but survives
- Subscription revenue grows to 55-60% of total
- SEC case settles (some restrictions, but not fatal)
- International expansion moderate success
- Trading fees slowly compress

**Revenue:** $7-9B annual (mid-cycle average)

**Net margin:** 15-25% (depending on cycle)

**Stock performance:** Range-bound $150-300, tracking crypto prices

---

## Summary

Coinbase's business model is fundamentally different from Circle:

**Revenue Sources:**
1. **Transaction fees (53%):** Ultra-cyclical, tied to crypto trading volume
2. **Stablecoin revenue (19%):** Recurring, tied to USDC growth and interest rates
3. **Staking (10%):** Growing fast, recurring, tied to crypto prices
4. **Custody (8%):** Sticky, institutional, Bitcoin ETFs are goldmine
5. **Interest income (3%):** Pure profit, tied to interest rates
6. **Other (8%):** Subscriptions, developer tools, etc.

**The Transformation:**
- 2020: 96% trading fees → Ultra-cyclical, volatile
- 2025: 53% trading fees → Becoming more diversified

**Key Insight:**

Coinbase is in the middle of a strategic shift from a trading platform (high revenue, high volatility) to a financial services company (lower revenue per user, but stable and recurring).

**If this transition succeeds:** Coinbase deserves a higher valuation multiple (less cyclical = less risky)

**If it fails:** Coinbase remains a volatile bet on crypto prices

**For investors:** Coinbase is a leveraged play on crypto adoption. Bull market = huge profits. Bear market = massive losses. The subscription revenue is growing but not yet large enough to smooth out the cycles.
