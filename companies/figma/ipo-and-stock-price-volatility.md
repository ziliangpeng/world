# Figma (FIG): IPO and Stock Price Volatility - The Complete Story

## Executive Summary

Figma went public on July 31, 2025, in one of the most anticipated tech IPOs of the year. The stock experienced extreme volatility:

- **IPO Price:** $33 per share
- **First-day close:** $115.50 (+250%)
- **Peak (August 1):** $142.92 (+333% from IPO)
- **Current (Dec 2025):** ~$38 (-73% from peak, barely above IPO)

**What happened:** Figma's IPO was massively underpriced, creating an instant 250% pop that briefly valued the company at $68 billion. The euphoria lasted days before reality set in: decelerating growth, extreme valuation (40x P/S), AI competition fears, and massive insider selling crushed the stock back to IPO levels within 4 months.

**Key lesson:** Even beloved, profitable companies with strong fundamentals can be terrible investments when bought at bubble valuations. Figma fell below its IPO price despite growing 40%+ and being profitable.

## Background: The Failed Adobe Acquisition

Before understanding the IPO, you need context on what led to it.

### The $20 Billion Deal That Wasn't (2022-2023)

**September 2022:**

- Adobe announced acquisition of Figma for **$20 billion**
- 50% cash, 50% stock
- Premium: ~50x Figma's revenue at the time
- Rationale: Eliminate fastest-growing competitor

**Why it mattered:**

- Figma was disrupting Adobe's design monopoly (Photoshop, Illustrator, XD)
- Figma's collaborative, browser-based approach was winning market share
- Adobe saw existential threat

**December 2023: Deal Blocked**

- UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the deal
- European Commission also opposed
- Antitrust concerns: Would eliminate Figma as independent competitor
- Adobe paid **$1 billion breakup fee** to Figma

**This breakup fee was nearly 3x all the capital Figma had ever raised.**

### Post-Adobe: The IPO Path

After the deal fell through:

- Figma had $1B in cash from breakup fee
- Company continued rapid growth (48% revenue growth in 2024)
- Management decided to go public instead of staying private
- Filed S-1 on July 1, 2025
- Priced IPO on July 30, 2025
- Began trading July 31, 2025

### July 31, 2025: IPO Day - The Massive Pop

**Trading Debut:**

- **Opening:** $85 per share (12:00 PM ET)
- **First trade:** 1:59 PM ET at $85 (+158% from IPO)
- **Intraday high:** $143
- **Close:** $115.50 (+250%)
- **Market cap:** ~$57 billion at close

**Volume:** Extremely heavy trading on day 1

**The Underpricing:**

Figma left **approximately $3-4 billion on the table**.

- If IPO priced at $90 (near opening): Would have raised $5.5B instead of $1.2B
- Difference: **~$4.3 billion** in unrealized value
- This went to institutional investors who got IPO allocations

**Who got rich on day 1:**

- Wall Street firms (underwriters and their clients)
- Institutional investors with IPO allocation
- Early investors who could sell via greenshoe

**Who didn't:**

- Figma itself (raised $1.2B instead of potential $4-5B)
- Retail investors (no IPO access, had to buy at $85+)

### August 1, 2025: The Peak

**Intraday high:** $142.92 (334% above IPO)

**Market cap:** ~$68 billion

- This valued Figma at:
  - ~80x trailing revenue
  - 3.4x Adobe's attempted $20B acquisition price
  - More than Zoom, Shopify, or Snowflake at the time

**The peak lasted less than 24 hours.**

### August 4, 2025: Reality Check Begins

**Stock sinks 27%** in a single day to $88.60

**What triggered it:**

- Profit-taking after 250%+ gains
- Valuation reality setting in (80x sales is absurd)
- No fundamental catalyst to sustain momentum
- Market realized the IPO pop was speculation, not fundamentals

**$21 billion in market cap** evaporated in days.

### September 3, 2025: Q2 Earnings - First Report as Public Company

**Results:**

- **Revenue:** $250 million (+41% YoY)
- **Guidance:** Q3 revenue $263-265M, FY2025 $1.021-$1.025B
- **Profitability:** Non-GAAP operating margin 5%, FCF margin 24%
- **Net Dollar Retention:** 129%

**The problem:**

- Revenue growth decelerating: 46% (Q1) → 41% (Q2) → guidance implies 37% (Q3)
- **Massive net loss:** $1.1 billion (on $250M revenue!)
  - Most was $975.7M in one-time stock-based compensation
  - But optics were terrible

**Stock reaction:** Plummeted **20%** after-hours to new lows

**Market's message:** "You're trading at 40x sales but growth is slowing. Not acceptable."

### September 5, 2025: Early Lockup Release Triggered

**Early Release Provision:**

- 25% of employee shares could trade early IF:
  - Stock traded at least 25% above IPO price for several consecutive days
- Threshold was easily cleared in early August (stock was 300%+ above IPO)

**Impact:**

- Index Ventures (Daniel Rimer) sold millions of shares
- Kleiner Perkins trimmed stakes
- Employees selling vested RSUs
- **19.6 million shares sold** in Q3 2025

**Why this hurt:**

- Massive supply hitting market
- Signal that insiders don't believe in current valuation
- Downward pressure on stock

### November 5, 2025: Q3 Earnings - Beat But Stock Still Falls

**Results:**

- **Revenue:** $274.2M (+38% YoY), beat guidance
- **EPS:** $0.10 non-GAAP (beat)
- **Raised FY guidance:** $1.044-1.046B revenue
- **Profitability:** 12% non-GAAP operating margin (improving)

**Stock reaction:** Ticked higher after-hours but couldn't sustain

**The problem:**

- Growth still decelerating (38% → 34% implied Q4)
- Stock down **>60% from IPO** despite beating estimates
- Valuation still high at 25-30x sales
- January 2026 lockup expiration looming

### November 17, 2025: Dylan Field Massive Sale

**CEO Dylan Field sold 3,029,063 shares for ~$113 million**

**Details:**

- Two large blocks at $37-38.50 average price
- Stated reason: Tax withholding for RSU vesting
- This was NOT a complete exit (Field still controls company with 74% voting rights)

**Market impact:**

- Added to negative sentiment
- Even "tax withholding" sales spook retail investors
- $113M is a huge amount for any insider

### November 21, 2025: Falls Below IPO Price

**Stock traded as low as $32.83** - below the $33 IPO price

**This is the ultimate humiliation for an IPO:**

- Anyone who bought shares in the IPO is now underwater (4 months later)
- All the "pop" gains completely erased
- $68B peak → $16B trough = 76% decline

### December 2025: Current State

**Stock:** ~$38 (range: $32-45 in recent weeks)

**Market cap:** ~$18-19 billion (basically IPO valuation)

**From peak:** -73% decline

**Upcoming catalyst:** January 27, 2026 - Full 180-day lockup expiration

## The Underpricing Scandal

### How Much Was Left on the Table?

**IPO Pricing Analysis:**

- Priced at $33, opened at $85, closed at $115.50
- Clear sign of massive underpricing

**Conservative estimate (using $85 opening):**

- 36.9M shares × ($85 - $33) = **$1.92 billion left on table**

**Aggressive estimate (using $115.50 close):**

- 36.9M shares × ($115.50 - $33) = **$3.04 billion left on table**

**Mid-range: ~$2.5 billion**

### Context of the Money Left Behind

**Figma's financial position:**

- Cash before IPO: ~$1B (from Adobe breakup fee)
- Amount raised: $1.2B
- **Amount left on table: ~$2.5B (2x what they actually raised!)**

### Why Was It So Underpriced?

**1. Deliberate strategy by underwriters:**

- Goldman, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan wanted to ensure "successful" IPO
- Reward institutional clients with instant gains
- Avoid the embarrassment of a "broken IPO" (below-IPO trading)

**2. Extreme demand:**

- Biggest tech IPO in 4 years
- Beloved product with loyal user base
- Failed Adobe deal created mystique
- FOMO from retail investors

**3. Uncertain market conditions:**

- Tech stocks volatile in 2025
- Hard to price in AI disruption concerns
- Conservative pricing given Adobe deal failure precedent

**4. Dual-class structure complexity:**

- Dylan Field controls 74% of voting power
- Makes valuation harder to pin down
- Governance concerns

### Who Benefited from Underpricing?

**Winners:**

- **Wall Street underwriters:** Fees + cheap allocation for clients
- **Institutional investors:** Got shares at $33, sold at $80-120
- **Early VC investors who sold:** Index, Kleiner, Sequoia made instant returns

**Losers:**

- **Figma shareholders:** Company raised $1.2B instead of $3-4B
- **Retail investors:** Had to buy at $85+, now many underwater
- **Employees with lockup:** Watched stock crash before they could sell

---

## What Drove the Surge?

### Fundamental Factors (20-30%)

**1. Strong business metrics:**

- 48% revenue growth
- Profitable (17% operating margin)
- 95% of Fortune 500 as customers
- 13M users, growing fast

**2. Market position:**

- Clear leader in collaborative design
- Disrupting Adobe's monopoly
- Product beloved by designers and PMs

**3. AI narrative:**

- Figma shipping AI features (Make 2.0, generative design)
- "AI-native design tools" buzz

### Speculative Factors (70-80%)

**1. IPO FOMO:**

- Biggest tech IPO in years
- No access for retail at IPO price
- "Don't want to miss the next Adobe"

**2. Adobe comparison:**

- "Adobe tried to buy for $20B, now it's public!"
- "Figma will take market share from $200B Adobe"
- Revenge narrative (regulators blocked Adobe, now Figma free to compete)

**3. Scarcity:**

- Limited float (insider lockups)
- High short interest (hard to borrow)
- Options trading frenzy

**4. Momentum trading:**

- Stock going up → More people buy → Stock goes up more
- Retail pile-in via Reddit, X, TikTok
- No fundamental anchor

**5. Crypto spillover:**

- Some of the same mania from crypto bull markets
- "Number go up" mentality

### Valuation at Peak Was Insane

**At $142.92 (peak):**

- Market cap: $68 billion
- Revenue (TTM): ~$900M
- **P/S ratio: ~75x**

**Comparison:**

- Adobe: $210B market cap, $20B revenue = 10.5x P/S
- Zoom: 6x P/S
- Shopify: 12x P/S
- Datadog: 18x P/S

**Figma would need to:**

- Grow revenue to $6.8B (7.5x current) to justify 10x P/S
- Maintain 40%+ growth for 5+ years straight
- Not lose market share to AI-native tools
- Compete against Adobe's $200B war chest

**The math didn't work. The market eventually figured it out.**

---

## What Drove the Crash?

### Fundamental Factors (60%)

**1. Growth deceleration:**

- Q1: 46% growth
- Q2: 41% growth
- Q3: 38% growth
- Q4 guidance: ~34% growth

**At 40x P/S, you need accelerating growth, not decelerating.**

**2. Valuation reality:**

- Can't justify 75x sales with slowing growth
- Comparison to Adobe showed Figma overvalued by 5-7x
- Even at $50 (25x sales), still expensive

**3. Profitability concerns:**

- Q2 showed $1.1B net loss (though mostly stock comp)
- Operating margins not expanding fast enough
- AI investments will pressure margins

**4. Competition fears:**

**Adobe:**

- Adobe AI ARR hit $5B in Q3 2025
- Adobe adding collaborative features to compete with Figma
- Adobe has deeper pockets for AI R&D

**AI-native startups:**

- OpenAI and others building AI-first design tools
- "Generate entire UIs from text prompts"
- Could bypass traditional design tools entirely

**Microsoft:**

- Integrating design into Office 365
- Massive distribution advantage
- Free/bundled with existing products

**5. Customer retention slip:**

- Q2 showed "slight decline" in retention
- For a SaaS company valued on NRR, this is bad

### Technical/Supply Factors (40%)

**1. Insider selling wave:**

**Q3 2025:**

- 19.6 million shares sold by insiders
- Index Ventures, Kleiner, early employees dumping

**November 2025:**

- Dylan Field sold $113M worth
- Even if for "tax purposes," it's massive supply

**2. Early lockup release (September 5):**

- 25% of shares unlocked early
- Employees who joined pre-IPO could finally cash out
- Many sold to diversify

**3. Options expiration dynamics:**

- Post-IPO options trading was wild
- As stock fell, gamma squeeze reversed
- Market makers covering short hedges = more selling

**4. Momentum reversal:**

- What goes up on momentum, falls on momentum
- No natural buyers at $100+ except speculators
- When speculation ends, stock collapses

---

## Insider Selling: The Timeline and Impact

### IPO: Dylan Field's Partial Sale

**IPO allocation:**

- Dylan Field sold 2.35 million shares at $33
- Raised: **$62 million** for Field personally
- But retained 74% voting control via dual-class structure

**Optics:**

- CEO selling in IPO is normal
- But $62M is a lot
- Suggested he didn't believe stock would stay high long

### Q3 2025: Major VC Sales

**Early lockup release** (September 5) triggered selling:

| Seller | Shares Sold | Approx Value | Reason |
|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Index Ventures (Daniel Rimer) | Several million | $200M+ | Early release |
| Kleiner Perkins | Several million | $150M+ | Early release |
| Early employees | Unknown | $50M+ | RSU vesting |
| **Total** | **~19.6M shares** | **$1B+** | |

**Price impact:**

- Stock fell from $80 → $50 during Q3
- Massive supply pressure
- Retail investors buying the falling knife

### November 17, 2025: Dylan Field's Big Sale

**The transaction:**

- **Shares sold:** 3,029,063 Class A shares
- **Proceeds:** ~$112.98 million
- **Average price:** $37-38.50
- **Reason stated:** Tax withholding for RSU vesting

**Context:**

- Field still has enormous holdings
- Still controls 74% of votes
- But $113M sale is significant signal

**Why it matters:**

- If CEO believed stock was undervalued at $38, why sell?
- Even for taxes, could have borrowed against shares
- Market interprets as "CEO thinks this is fair value"

### January 27, 2026: The Big Lockup Expiration

**What's coming:**

- **180-day lockup expires** (standard IPO restriction)
- Potentially **77.7 million additional shares** become tradeable
- This includes:
  - Remaining early employees
  - VCs who didn't sell in early release
  - Co-founder Evan Wallace (likely)
  - Other executives

**Historical precedent:**

- Lockup expirations often cause 10-30% stock drops
- Especially when stock already down (like Figma)
- Employees who've seen paper wealth evaporate want to lock in gains

**Extended lockup:**

- Holders of 54.1% of Class A shares agreed to extended lockup until Q2 2026 earnings or August 31, 2026
- This is good news (less supply)
- But still leaves ~45% that can sell in January

**Market is already pricing this in:**

- Stock weakness in November/December partly due to January lockup fear
- Professional investors shorting ahead of expected supply

## Comparison to Other IPO Disasters

### Similar Recent Cases

| Company | IPO Date | IPO Price | Peak | Peak Date | Current/Trough | Peak-to-Trough |
|---------|----------|-----------|------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Figma (FIG)** | Jul 2025 | $33 | $142.92 | Aug 2025 | $38 (-73%) | -73% |
| **Circle (CRCL)** | Jun 2025 | $31 | $298.99 | Jun 2025 | $84 (-72%) | -72% |
| Coinbase (COIN) | Apr 2021 | $381 | $429 | Apr 2021 | $40 (-91%) | -91% |
| Robinhood (HOOD) | Jul 2021 | $38 | $85 | Aug 2021 | $8 (-91%) | -91% |
| Snowflake (SNOW) | Sep 2020 | $120 | $429 | Dec 2020 | $116 (-73%) | -73% |
| Rivian (RIVN) | Nov 2021 | $78 | $179 | Nov 2021 | $10 (-94%) | -94% |

### The Pattern

**All these IPOs share:**

1. **Massive first-day pop** (100%+)
2. **Surge to peak within weeks** on hype/momentum
3. **Crash 70-90% within 6-24 months** as fundamentals matter
4. **Insider selling near peak** (they know it's overvalued)
5. **Retail investors left holding bags** (bought the hype)

**Figma fits this pattern PERFECTLY.**

### What Made Figma Different?

**Unique aspects:**

1. **Actually profitable at IPO** - Unlike Rivian, Coinbase (at time), Snowflake
2. **Strong product-market fit** - Beloved product, not just hype
3. **Adobe acquisition backstory** - Created extra mystique
4. **Fell below IPO price in just 4 months** - Faster than most

**But the outcome is the same: Great company, terrible investment at IPO price.**

---

## Key Lessons and Takeaways

### For Figma

**What went right:**

- Raised $1.2B in IPO despite leaving billions on table
- Successfully went public after Adobe deal failed
- Maintained growth and profitability as public company
- Still controls its destiny (Dylan Field has 74% voting control)

**What went wrong:**

- Left $2-3B on table due to extreme underpricing
- Stock collapse damaged brand and employee morale
- Harder to use stock as acquisition currency
- Employee retention risk (underwater options/RSUs)

**Challenges ahead:**

- Prove growth can re-accelerate
- Compete with Adobe's AI push
- Navigate AI-native competition
- Survive January lockup expiration without further crash

### For Investors

**Who made money:**

- IPO allocation recipients (if sold at $80-120)
- Short sellers from peak
- Early VCs who sold in $80-100 range

**Who lost money:**

- Anyone who bought at $80+ (deeply underwater)
- Employees with lockup restrictions (watched crash happen)
- Long-term believers who held through decline

**Key lessons:**

1. **IPO pops are not free money** - They often reverse completely
2. **Valuation always matters** - Even great companies are bad investments at wrong price
3. **Watch insider selling** - When VCs sell early, they know something
4. **Growth deceleration kills high P/S stocks** - Need acceleration to justify 40x+
5. **Lockup expirations are real** - Not just theoretical, they cause selling
6. **Fundamentals eventually win** - Hype lasts days/weeks, fundamentals last years

### For Employees

**The tragedy:**

- Early employees saw paper wealth surge to millions
- But couldn't sell (lockup restrictions)
- Watched it crash back to IPO level
- Many RSUs now underwater or barely in the money

**Example:**

- Employee with 10,000 RSUs
- At peak ($142): Worth $1.42M
- At current ($38): Worth $380K
- **Lost $1.04M in paper wealth they couldn't realize**

**This creates retention risk:**

- Employees feel cheated (rightly so)
- May leave for companies with better equity situations
- Figma will need to issue more equity to retain talent

---

## The Valuation Question: What's Fair Value?

### Bull Case: $80-100 (2-3x current)

**If you believe:**

- Growth re-accelerates to 40%+
- Figma successfully competes with Adobe AI push
- Wins enterprise market with security/compliance features
- Expands into new categories (presentations, videos, etc.)
- AI features drive higher pricing power

**Valuation:**

- 2026 revenue: $1.3-1.4B (30-35% growth)
- Fair P/S: 25-30x (high-growth SaaS)
- Fair value: $32-42B market cap = $70-90/share
- Upside: 85-140% from $38

**Catalysts:**

- Q4/Q1 earnings beat with accelerating growth
- Major enterprise wins announced
- AI features driving ARR growth
- Adobe showing weakness in competitive positioning

### Bear Case: $25-35 (below current)

**If you believe:**

- Growth continues decelerating to 20-25%
- AI-native tools disrupt traditional design software
- Adobe catches up with collaboration features
- Customer retention continues declining
- January lockup causes major selloff

**Valuation:**

- 2026 revenue: $1.2-1.3B (20-25% growth)
- Fair P/S: 15-20x (slower-growth SaaS)
- Fair value: $18-26B market cap = $35-55/share
- Downside: -8% to +45% from $38

**Catalysts:**

- Continued growth deceleration
- Major customer loss (e.g., Microsoft pulls out)
- Adobe aggressive competitive response
- January lockup flood

### Base Case: $45-65 (20-70% upside)

**Most likely scenario:**

- Growth stabilizes at 30-35%
- Figma maintains design tool leadership
- Adobe competes but doesn't crush them
- AI is net neutral (helps and hurts)
- Multiple compresses to fair value over time

**Valuation:**

- 2026 revenue: $1.3B (30% growth)
- Fair P/S: 20-25x (quality SaaS)
- Fair value: $26-32B market cap = $52-65/share
- **Expected return: 37-71% from $38**

**This assumes:**

- No major surprises (positive or negative)
- Market values Figma like other high-quality SaaS (Datadog, MongoDB)
- Lockup doesn't crater stock further

## Upcoming Catalysts and Risks

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 3-6 Months)

**January 27, 2026: Full Lockup Expiration**

- **Biggest near-term risk**
- 77.7M shares potentially tradeable (though 54% extended lockup)
- Could pressure stock 10-30% if heavy selling
- Employees who've seen wealth evaporate may rush to sell

**Q4 2025 Earnings (Late January/Early February 2026)**

- Guidance was $292-294M revenue (31% growth)
- Anything below 30% growth = stock tanks
- Need to show margin expansion (target: 15%+ operating margin)
- Customer metrics: Net dollar retention, enterprise customer adds

**Q1 2026 Earnings (May 2026)**

- First post-lockup earnings
- Critical to show business unaffected by lockup selling
- Growth needs to stabilize or re-accelerate

### Medium-Term Catalysts (6-18 Months)

**AI product launches:**

- Figma needs to show AI driving incremental revenue
- Not just features, but new pricing tiers or products
- Compete with Adobe Firefly AI success

**Major enterprise deals:**

- Landing Fortune 100 companies
- Expanding beyond design to broader workflow
- Competing with Microsoft Office ecosystem

**Adobe competitive response:**

- If Adobe bundles strong collaborative design with Creative Cloud
- If Adobe Firefly AI proves superior to Figma AI
- If Adobe undercuts on price

**AI-native startup threat:**

- Companies like Uizard, Galileo AI, v0.dev growing
- If one gets major traction, could disrupt Figma
- OpenAI/Anthropic building design agents

### Long-Term Questions (18+ Months)

**Can Figma become a $5B+ revenue company?**

- Need 30%+ growth for 4-5 years
- Requires expanding TAM beyond design
- International expansion critical

**What's the end game?**

- Stay independent and grow?
- Get acquired (by who? Adobe blocked, Microsoft?)
- Become the "operating system for creative work"?

**How does AI reshape the design tool market?**

- Is traditional design software obsolete in 5 years?
- Can Figma evolve to AI-native fast enough?
- Or does a new startup leapfrog everyone?

## The Adobe Comparison

### The Acquisition That Wasn't

**What Adobe saw in 2022:**

- Figma growing 50%+ annually
- Taking market share from Adobe XD, Sketch
- Beloved by designers (better UX than Adobe)
- Collaborative features Adobe lacked
- Browser-based = future of software

**Why $20B made sense (to Adobe):**

- Eliminate fastest-growing competitor
- 35x Figma's revenue at time, but...
- Worth it to protect $200B monopoly
- Adobe's Creative Cloud under threat

**Why regulators blocked it:**

- Would reduce competition in design software
- Adobe already dominant in creative tools
- Figma was only viable independent competitor
- Concerns about Adobe monopoly extending

### How They Compare Today (December 2025)

| Metric | Figma | Adobe |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Market Cap** | $18B | $158B |
| **Revenue (TTM)** | $1.0B | $20B |
| **Revenue Growth** | 35-40% | 10-15% |
| **Profitability** | Break-even to slight profit | Highly profitable (30%+ margin) |
| **P/S Ratio** | 18x | 7.9x |
| **AI ARR** | Unknown, small | $5B+ |
| **Employees** | ~1,500 | ~29,000 |
| **Product** | Figma (design) | Creative Cloud (20+ products) |
| **Distribution** | Viral, bottom-up | Enterprise sales, bundling |

### Who's Winning?

**Figma's advantages:**

- Faster growth (35% vs 12%)
- Better UX and collaboration
- Modern, browser-based architecture
- Viral adoption model
- Design team favorite

**Adobe's advantages:**

- 20x larger revenue base
- Profitable with massive cash flow
- Can outspend on AI R&D ($5B AI ARR already)
- Bundling power (Creative Cloud ecosystem)
- Enterprise sales force

**Likely outcome:**

- Both can coexist
- Figma dominates collaborative design, startups, small teams
- Adobe dominates enterprise, creative professionals, existing customers
- The real threat to both: AI-native tools that make traditional design obsolete

## What Would Need to Happen for Figma to Hit $200?

Let's work backwards from a $200 stock price (5x current).

**At $200/share:**

- Market cap: ~$95 billion
- This would be ~60% of Adobe's current market cap

**To justify $95B valuation:**

**Scenario 1: High-growth SaaS multiple (25x P/S)**

- Need revenue of $3.8B
- Current: $1.0B
- Requires: 3.8x revenue growth
- Timeline: 4 years at 40% CAGR
- **Probability: 10-20%** (very difficult)

**Scenario 2: Mega-multiple SaaS (50x P/S)**

- Need revenue of $1.9B
- Requires: 1.9x revenue growth
- Timeline: 2 years at 38% growth
- But 50x P/S requires 60%+ growth
- **Probability: <5%** (near impossible)

**What would it take:**

1. **Re-accelerate growth to 50%+** for multiple years
2. **Expand TAM massively** - beyond design to all creative work
3. **AI breakthrough** - Figma AI becomes industry standard
4. **Displace Adobe** - Steal significant market share
5. **Enterprise dominance** - Become default for F500 companies
6. **Perfect execution** - No missteps for 4+ years
7. **Tech bull market** - SaaS multiples expand back to 2021 levels

**Bottom line: To hit $200, Figma needs to become a very different company than it is today. Possible? Yes. Likely? No.**

## The Bottom Line: What Really Happened

### The Story in One Paragraph

Figma, the beloved design collaboration tool that Adobe tried to buy for $20B, went public in July 2025 at $33/share and instantly tripled on first-day hype, briefly reaching $143 and a $68B valuation. This proved to be pure speculation - the company was trading at 75x sales despite decelerating growth. As reality set in (growth slowing from 46% to 34%, massive insider selling, AI competition fears, and sky-high valuation), the stock crashed back to IPO levels in just 4 months. Figma fell below its IPO price by November, erasing $50 billion in market cap. This is a textbook case of IPO underpricing, momentum-driven bubble, and the harsh reality that even exceptional companies are terrible investments at insane valuations. The stock remains in limbo as investors wait to see if growth stabilizes or continues decelerating.

### Who Made Money

**Big winners:**

- IPO allocation recipients who sold at $80-140 (100-300%+ gains)
- Early VCs who sold at $80-120 in Q3 (Index, Kleiner)
- Short sellers from peak to trough (200%+ gains if shorted at $140)
- Wall Street underwriters (fees + cheap shares for clients)

**Modest winners:**

- Employees who sold during early lockup window ($60-80)
- Traders who bought low $30s, sold $80-100

**Losers:**

- Anyone who bought at $80+ (down 40-70%)
- Employees still in lockup (watched wealth evaporate)
- Figma itself (left $2-3B on table from underpricing)
- Long-term retail holders expecting growth stock

### Investment Thesis Today

**At $38, is Figma a buy?**

**Yes, if:**

- You believe in long-term SaaS growth story
- Think valuation is now reasonable (18x sales)
- Expect growth to stabilize at 30%+
- Willing to hold through January lockup volatility
- View it as a 3-5 year investment, not short-term trade

**No, if:**

- You think AI tools will disrupt design software
- Concerned about Adobe competitive response
- See growth decelerating further to <25%
- Think market will re-rate SaaS multiples lower
- January lockup will crush stock further

**Neutral/Wait if:**

- Want to see Q4 earnings first
- Prefer to wait until after January lockup
- Need evidence of growth re-acceleration
- Looking for better risk/reward elsewhere

### Fair Value Estimate

**Base case: $50-65** (30-70% upside)

- 2026E revenue: $1.3-1.4B
- Growth: 28-35%
- Fair multiple: 20-22x P/S (quality SaaS)
- Market cap: $26-31B

**At $38, there's decent upside if fundamentals hold.**

But there's also real downside risk if growth disappoints or January lockup floods market with supply.

## Conclusion

Figma's IPO story is nearly identical to Circle's, Snowflake's, Coinbase's, and dozens of other hyped IPOs:

1. Underpriced to guarantee "success"
2. Instant pop on first day (150-300%)
3. Surge to absurd peak within days
4. Reality check as growth/valuation mismatch becomes clear
5. Crash back to earth (often below IPO price)
6. Retail investors crushed, insiders and Wall Street profit

**The lesson is always the same: Great companies can be terrible investments at the wrong price.**

Figma is probably a good company. It has real revenue, real profits, real customers, and a real product that people love.

But at $143, it was a terrible investment. At $38, it might be a decent one.

The difference between a 75x P/S and an 18x P/S is the difference between mania and rationality.

**Welcome to the IPO casino. The house always wins.**
