# Robinhood: Founding Story and Company History

## Executive Summary

Robinhood was founded on April 18, 2013, by Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, two Stanford physics graduates who previously built trading software for Wall Street firms. Inspired by the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, they launched the first commission-free trading app in 2015 with the mission to "democratize finance for all." The company grew from 500K users in 2015 to 24M+ users in 2025, forcing the entire brokerage industry to eliminate commissions. However, Robinhood's journey has been marked by extreme controversy—from the tragic death of a user due to a UI bug, to the GameStop trading halt that led to Congressional testimony, to 32% workforce cuts during crypto winter. Despite the turbulence, Robinhood IPO'd at $32B in 2021 and has evolved into a profitable multi-asset trading platform generating $1.27B quarterly revenue.

**Key Milestones:**

- 2013: Founded by Stanford roommates with trading software background
- 2015: Launched commission-free trading app (first in US)
- 2020: Explosive pandemic growth, 13M users
- 2021: GameStop scandal, Congressional hearing, $32B IPO
- 2022: Crypto winter, 32% workforce reduction
- 2025: 24M users, $1.27B quarterly revenue, 43.8% net margin

## The Founding Story (2013)

### Stanford Roommates with a Vision

**The co-founders:**

- **Vlad Tenev:** B.S. in Mathematics from Stanford
- **Baiju Bhatt:** B.S. in Physics, M.S. in Mathematics from Stanford

**How they met:**

Tenev and Bhatt were **roommates and classmates at Stanford University**, studying physics and mathematics together. After graduating, they moved to New York City to build technology companies.

### Two Failed Attempts Before Robinhood

**2010: Celeris**

Their first venture was **Celeris**, a high-frequency trading (HFT) software company based in New York.

**The problem:**

- Built sophisticated trading algorithms
- Targeted hedge funds and trading firms
- **Abandoned by January 2011** - couldn't get traction

**2011-2013: Chronos Research**

Their second attempt was **Chronos Research**, which sold low-latency trading software to Wall Street firms and banks.

**What they learned:**

While selling software to major financial institutions, Tenev and Bhatt discovered a shocking inequality:

- **Big Wall Street firms:** Pay effectively **$0** to trade stocks
- **Regular Americans:** Charged **$7-10 commission per trade** (E-Trade, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade)

**The insight:**

High-frequency trading firms execute millions of trades per day at near-zero cost, while a college student buying 10 shares pays $10 in commissions. This felt fundamentally unfair.

### The Occupy Wall Street Moment

**2011: Occupy Wall Street protests**

Both Tenev and Bhatt closely followed the **Occupy Wall Street movement** (September-November 2011), where protesters camped in Zuccotti Park demanding financial system reform.

**Key messages from Occupy Wall Street:**

- "We are the 99%"
- Wall Street profits while Main Street suffers
- Financial system rigged for the wealthy
- Demand economic equality

**The founders' reaction:**

The protests crystallized their mission: **democratize access to financial markets**. If Wall Street pays nothing to trade, why should regular people?

### Birth of Robinhood (April 18, 2013)

**Official founding date:** April 18, 2013

**The name:**

"Robinhood" comes from the legendary English folk hero **Robin Hood**, who "stole from the rich to give to the poor."

**The mission statement:**

> "Democratize finance for all"

**The product vision:**

- Zero-commission stock trading
- Beautiful mobile app (not clunky desktop software)
- No account minimums
- Instant access
- Make investing as easy as ordering an Uber

### Building in Stealth (2013-2015)

**Two years of development:**

Unlike typical startups that launch quickly, Robinhood spent **nearly 2 years** building the product before public release.

**Why so long:**

- Regulatory complexity (need broker-dealer license, FINRA approval)
- Building clearing infrastructure
- Security and compliance requirements
- Perfecting the mobile UI/UX

**The waitlist strategy:**

Before launch, they built a viral waitlist:

- Announced the concept but didn't launch immediately
- **1 million people** on waitlist before app went live
- Gamified mechanism: Refer friends to move up in line
- Created massive FOMO (fear of missing out)
- Free marketing through word-of-mouth

---

## The Launch and Early Growth (2015-2016)

### March 2015: Public Launch

**The first commission-free trading app in America**

**Key features:**

- Trade stocks and ETFs with **zero commissions**
- **Mobile-first** design (iOS, later Android)
- No account minimums (open account with $1)
- Instant account approval
- Clean, minimalist interface

**How it worked:**

- Users link bank account
- Deposit money
- Buy/sell stocks instantly
- No $7-10 fee per trade (vs competitors)

**The business model (hidden):**

- Revenue from **Payment for Order Flow (PFOF)**
- Sell customer orders to market makers (Citadel, Virtu)
- Market makers pay Robinhood to execute trades
- Users don't see this (they just see "free")

### First Year Traction (2015)

**User growth:**

- **500,000+ users** signed up in first year
- Average user age: **26 years old** (vs 50+ at traditional brokers)
- Mobile-native millennials
- Many first-time investors

**The Robinhood demographic:**

- Young (20s-30s)
- Tech-savvy
- Modest account balances ($500-5,000)
- Active traders (vs buy-and-hold)

### 2016: Crossing 1 Million Users

**Rapid growth:**

- Hit **1 million users** in 2016
- Zero paid marketing (all word-of-mouth and press)
- Competitors started panicking

**Industry impact:**

Traditional brokers realized they had to respond. The $7-10 commission business model was under threat.

---

## Product Expansion (2017-2019)

### 2017: Robinhood Gold Launch

**The first paid product:**

In February 2017, Robinhood launched **Robinhood Gold** ($5/month subscription).

**Features:**

- **Margin trading** (borrow money to trade)
- **Larger instant deposits** ($50K vs $1K)
- **Extended trading hours** (pre-market and after-hours)
- **Professional research tools**

**Why this mattered:**

- First revenue stream beyond PFOF

- Margin lending = interest income

### 2018: Crypto Trading Launch

**Commission-free cryptocurrency trading**

Robinhood added **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and others** with zero fees.

**The disruption:**

- **Coinbase:** Charged 1-4% per crypto trade
- **Robinhood:** 0% commission (small spread markup)

**Impact:**

- Stole market share from Coinbase for retail crypto
- Made crypto accessible to millions
- Crypto became major revenue driver (especially during bull markets)

### 2019: Fractional Shares and Cash Management

**Fractional shares:**

- Buy **0.01 share** of any stock
- Now you can own Amazon for $30 instead of needing $3,000
- Massively democratizing for small investors

**Cash management:**

- Checking/savings accounts with **FDIC insurance**
- Partner banks provide insurance
- Earn interest on uninvested cash
- Compete with banks, not just brokers

**User milestone:**

By end of 2019: **10 million users**

---

## The Pandemic Boom (2020)

### March 2020: Systemwide Outage Crisis

**March 2, 2020:**

Robinhood suffered an **all-day, systemwide outage** during a massive market rally.

**The timing couldn't be worse:**

- S&P 500 climbed **+4.6%** (one of biggest rallies in years)
- Users completely locked out of app
- Couldn't buy or sell anything
- Lost thousands in opportunity cost

**The fallout:**

- **Class action lawsuits** filed
- Exposed infrastructure problems
- Revealed Robinhood's systems couldn't handle peak load
- Credibility hit

**Robinhood's response:**

- Apologized
- Offered compensation (limited)
- Upgraded infrastructure

### March-December 2020: Explosive Pandemic Growth

**The perfect storm:**

1. **COVID lockdowns** - Everyone stuck at home
2. **Stimulus checks** - Free money to invest
3. **Sports betting shut down** - Gamblers turned to stocks
4. **Zero commissions** - Easy to day trade
5. **Fractional shares** - Start with $10

**The results:**

- Added **3 million users in Q1 2020 alone**
- By end of 2020: **13 million users** (30% growth in one year)
- Trading volume exploded
- PFOF revenue surged

**The new retail trader:**

- Day trading stocks like Tesla, Apple, Amazon
- Options trading (especially risky weekly options)
- Following r/WallStreetBets on Reddit
- YOLO (You Only Live Once) mentality

### June 2020: The Alexander Kearns Tragedy

**What happened:**

On June 19, 2020, **20-year-old Robinhood user Alexander Kearns** took his own life.

**The UI bug:**

- Kearns traded options (bull put spreads)
- Robinhood's UI showed a **-$730,000 balance**
- This was a temporary display error during options assignment
- His actual loss was much smaller (likely near zero)
- He didn't understand it was temporary

**The note:**

Kearns left a note asking "How was a 20 year old with no income able to get assigned almost a million dollars worth of leverage?"

**The aftermath:**

- Kearns' family sued Robinhood
- Robinhood settled for **$1.25 million**
- Robinhood improved options education and warnings
- Added customer service phone support (didn't have it before!)
- Required additional approvals for risky options strategies

**The criticism:**

- Robinhood made options trading too easy
- Gamified interface encouraged reckless behavior
- Confetti animations celebrated trades (removed after backlash)
- No human support when users needed help

---

## The GameStop Scandal (January 2021)

### The Setup: r/WallStreetBets vs Wall Street

**The community:**

Reddit's **r/WallStreetBets** (WSB) community discovered that **GameStop (GME)** was heavily shorted by hedge funds.

**The short squeeze thesis:**

- GameStop shorted **>100%** of float (more shorts than shares exist)
- If retail investors buy and hold, shorts forced to cover
- Creates "short squeeze" → price to the moon
- Punish hedge funds that bet against GameStop

**Key figures:**

- **Keith Gill ("Roaring Kitty", "DeepFuckingValue"):** Posted GME thesis on WSB, became folk hero
- **Hedge funds shorting GME:** Melvin Capital, Citron Research, others

### The Squeeze: January 2021

**The rocket:**

- Jan 1: GME at **$20**
- Jan 13: GME at **$40**
- Jan 22: GME at **$65**
- Jan 25: GME at **$147**
- Jan 27: GME at **$347**
- Jan 28 pre-market: GME hit **$483** (+2,300% in one month)

**Other meme stocks:**

- **AMC** (movie theaters): $2 → $20
- **BB** (BlackBerry): $7 → $28
- **NOK** (Nokia): $4 → $9
- **BBBY** (Bed Bath & Beyond): $17 → $53

**The euphoria:**

- "GME to $1000!"
- "Diamond hands 💎🙌" (hold forever, never sell)
- "We like the stock"
- Retail vs Wall Street narrative
- David vs Goliath

### January 28, 2021: The Trading Halt

**5am EST:**

Robinhood receives a call from its clearinghouse (DTCC): They need to post **$3 billion in collateral** due to extreme volatility.

**The problem:**

Robinhood didn't have $3 billion in liquid capital.

**The negotiation:**

Robinhood negotiated the requirement down to **$1.4 billion**.

**The decision:**

At market open, Robinhood **restricted buying** of GameStop and 12 other meme stocks:

- Users could **sell only** (not buy)
- Existing positions could be closed
- No new positions allowed

**The immediate impact:**

- GME crashed from **$483 to $112** (-77%) in one day
- Other meme stocks crashed similarly
- Millions lost money
- Fury erupted

### The Backlash: "Robinhood Robbed the Hood"

**Public outrage:**

- "Robinhood protects hedge funds, not retail!"
- "Market manipulation!"
- "Only rich allowed to win!"
- "Democratize finance was a lie!"

**Political response (rare bipartisan agreement):**

- **AOC (Democrat):** "This is unacceptable"
- **Ted Cruz (Republican):** "Fully agree"
- **Donald Trump Jr.:** "This is what a rigged system looks like"

**Legal response:**

- **Dozens of class action lawsuits** filed immediately
- Allegations of market manipulation, breach of fiduciary duty

**Congressional response:**

House Financial Services Committee announced hearing within days.

### February 18, 2021: Congressional Hearing

**Official title:**

"Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide"

**Witnesses:**

1. **Vlad Tenev** - Robinhood CEO
2. **Keith Gill** ("Roaring Kitty") - GameStop retail investor
3. **Kenneth Griffin** - Citadel CEO (largest PFOF buyer)
4. **Gabriel Plotkin** - Melvin Capital CEO (lost $6B+ shorting GME)
5. **Steve Huffman** - Reddit co-founder

**Key testimony from Vlad Tenev:**

Opening statement:

> "I'm sorry for what happened. We'll do better."

On the $3 billion collateral call:

> "At that exact moment we would not have been able to post the $3 billion in collateral."

On hedge fund pressure:

> **Question:** "Were you pressured by hedge funds to restrict trading?"
> **Tenev:** "Zero. Absolutely not."

**Key testimony from Keith Gill ("Roaring Kitty"):**

> "I like the stock. I'm not a cat."

(Reference to meme that he might be a bot, not a real person)

**Key testimony from Kenneth Griffin (Citadel):**

Citadel pays Robinhood for order flow but denied any role in trading restrictions:

> "Let me be perfectly clear: We had no role in Robinhood's decision to limit trading."

**Congressional focus:**

- Is PFOF a conflict of interest?
- Does gamification encourage reckless trading?
- Should retail investors be protected from risky options?
- Were clearinghouse requirements reasonable?

**Outcome:**

- No immediate legislation
- Increased SEC scrutiny
- FINRA fines later issued
- Robinhood reputation damaged

## The IPO (July 2021)

### July 29, 2021: Going Public

**IPO details:**

- Listed on **Nasdaq** under ticker **HOOD**
- Pricing: **$38 per share**
- Capital raised: **$2 billion**
- Valuation: **~$32 billion**
- Total users: **19 million**

**Unique approach: Democratizing the IPO**

Robinhood reserved **20-35% of IPO shares** for its own customers:

- Traditional IPOs: Only institutions get IPO shares
- Robinhood: Retail users can buy at IPO price
- Allocated **$440M-770M** to retail users
- "Practicing what we preach" on democratization

### Day 1: Disappointing Debut

**Performance:**

- Opened around $38
- Quickly dropped to **$35**
- Closed **-8.4%** on first day

**Why the poor performance:**

- GameStop controversy still fresh
- Users still angry about trading restrictions
- Concerns about PFOF regulatory risk
- Competition from traditional brokers (all now commission-free)

---

## Post-IPO Challenges (2021-2022)

### October 2021: Data Breach

**The breach:**

Robinhood disclosed that **7 million users** were affected by a data breach.

**What was stolen:**

- Email addresses for **5 million users**
- Full names for **2 million users**
- More detailed information for **~300 users** (names, dates of birth, zip codes)
- Customer support phone number exposed

**How it happened:**

- Social engineering attack
- Hacker convinced customer support employee to provide access
- Not a technical hack, but a human error

**The response:**

- Notified affected users
- Improved security training
- Engaged cybersecurity firm
- More bad press

### 2022: Crypto Winter and Mass Layoffs

**April 2022: First layoffs**

- Cut **9% of workforce** (~300 employees)
- CEO Vlad Tenev announced in blog post
- Reason: "duplicate roles" after growing too fast

**August 2022: Deeper cuts**

- Cut **23% of workforce** (~780 employees)
- Total: **~1,080 jobs lost** (32% reduction from peak)

**Why the mass layoffs:**

1. **Crypto winter:** Bitcoin crashed from $69K to $18K
2. **Stock market decline:** S&P 500 down 20%+ (bear market)
3. **Trading volume collapsed:** Revenue dropped
4. **User growth stalled:** Adding fewer new accounts
5. **Over-hiring:** Hired too aggressively in 2020-2021 boom

**Stock crash:**

- IPO price: **$38**
- August 2022 low: **$8** (-79%)
- Market cap: $32B → $7B

**The admission:**

Tenev's blog post:

> "We grew headcount too quickly. In this new environment, we need to operate more efficiently."

Sound familiar? Same playbook as Coinbase.

### Regulatory Fines and Scrutiny

**FINRA fine (2021): $70 million**

Violations included:

---

## Cultural Impact and Legacy

### Forced Industry-Wide Change

**Before Robinhood:**

- E-Trade: $7 per trade
- Charles Schwab: $7 per trade
- TD Ameritrade: $7 per trade
- Fidelity: $5 per trade

**After Robinhood (2019):**

- **All major brokers went to $0 commissions**
- Schwab eliminated commissions in October 2019
- E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity followed within days
- Robinhood forced entire industry to change

### Democratization (For Real)

**What Robinhood actually democratized:**

1. **Zero commissions** - Now industry standard
2. **Fractional shares** - Own any stock with $1
3. **Mobile trading** - Invest from your phone
4. **No minimums** - Open account with any amount
5. **Crypto access** - Trade Bitcoin as easily as stocks
6. **Options for retail** - Anyone can trade options (for better or worse)

**The numbers:**

- **24M+ users** who might never have invested
- Average age **35** vs 50+ at traditional brokers
- Many first-time investors
- Lowered barrier to entry for millions

### The Dark Side: Gamification and Harm

**The criticism:**

- Made trading **too easy** (like a game)
- Encouraged **excessive trading** (good for PFOF, bad for users)
- **Options trading** approval too lenient (Alexander Kearns)
- **Push notifications** to trade more
- **Confetti animations** celebrating trades (removed after backlash)

**Studies showed:**

- Robinhood users trade more frequently than other brokers
- More likely to trade risky options
- Younger users more susceptible to gamification

**The question:**

Is democratizing access good if people hurt themselves with it?

### The PFOF Dilemma

**The irony:**

- **Mission:** Democratize finance for all
- **Business model:** Sell user orders to hedge funds for profit

**The conflict:**

- Users think trading is "free"
- Actually, their orders are the product
- Robinhood sells to highest bidder (Citadel, Virtu)
- Market makers profit from spread
- Users get slightly worse execution

**The defense:**

- PFOF allows zero commissions
- Without PFOF, would need to charge fees
- Price improvement often better than exchanges
- SEC allows it, so it's legal

**The counterargument:**

- Hidden costs worse than transparent fees
- Conflict of interest (profit from more trading = encourage more trading)
- EU banned PFOF in 2026
- May get banned in US eventually

## Lessons from the Robinhood Story

### 1. Disruption Attracts Backlash

Robinhood forced the entire brokerage industry to $0 commissions, but became the villain during GameStop. Sometimes the disruptor gets blamed for chaos they unleashed.

### 2. Business Model Matters

PFOF enabled zero commissions but created conflicts of interest. When your revenue comes from selling user orders, you're incentivized to maximize trading volume.

### 3. Gamification is a Double-Edged Sword

Beautiful, fun UI attracted millions of young users. But "making trading fun" led to criticism of encouraging reckless behavior.

### 4. Crisis Management is Critical

GameStop trading halt was a liquidity issue, but terrible communication made it seem like a conspiracy. Perception matters more than reality.

### 5. Regulation Can Kill Your Business

72.8% of income from PFOF. If SEC bans it (like EU did), Robinhood's business model collapses overnight.

### 6. Boom-Bust Cycles are Real

2020-2021: Explosive growth, IPO at $32B
2022: Crypto winter, layoffs, stock crashes 79%
2025: Recovery, profitability

If you can't survive the bust, you won't enjoy the next boom.

### 7. Mission vs Reality

"Democratize finance for all" is a beautiful mission. But when you sell user orders for profit and encourage excessive trading, the mission gets murky.

## The Unanswered Question

**Did Robinhood democratize finance or democratize financial ruin?**

**The optimist's view:**

- 24M+ people now invest who never would have
- Zero commissions forced industry change
- Fractional shares opened doors
- Made investing accessible

**The pessimist's view:**

- Gamification encourages reckless trading
- PFOF is hidden exploitation
- Young people lost money on risky options
- Alexander Kearns tragedy
- GameStop betrayal

**The realist's view:**

Both are true. Robinhood lowered barriers (good) but also lowered guardrails (bad). Democratization means giving power to people—what they do with it is up to them.

**The irony:**

A company inspired by Occupy Wall Street now makes most of its money by selling retail orders to the very Wall Street firms the movement protested against.

## What's Next for Robinhood?

### 2026-2027 Strategy

**International expansion:**

- UK launched in 2024
- Europe next (via Bitstamp)
- Asia potential

**Product diversification:**

- Retirement accounts (IRAs growing)
- Crypto staking (earn yield on ETH, SOL)
- Prediction markets expansion
- Credit cards, loans

**Reducing PFOF dependence:**

- Grow subscriptions (Gold to 10M subscribers)
- Interest income (margin lending)
- Transaction fees on crypto
- Other revenue streams

### The Big Risks

**1. PFOF regulatory ban**

If SEC follows EU and bans PFOF, 72.8% of income disappears overnight. Would need to charge commissions or find new model.

**2. Competition**

Every broker now offers zero commissions. What's Robinhood's moat?

**3. Crypto volatility**

21% of revenue from crypto. If Bitcoin crashes again, revenue drops.

**4. Reputation damage**

GameStop scandal haunts them. Can they rebuild trust?

### The Big Opportunities

**1. Become a full financial services platform**

- Banking (checking, savings, loans)
- Crypto (trading, staking, custody)
- Investing (stocks, bonds, retirement)
- Credit cards, insurance

**2. Ride crypto adoption**

If crypto goes mainstream, Robinhood is positioned perfectly with 24M users and Bitstamp acquisition.

**3. International markets**

US is saturated. Europe, Asia, Latin America are wide open.
