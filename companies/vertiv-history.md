# Vertiv Holdings Co - Founding Story & Company History

## The Origins: Ralph Liebert's Garage Innovation (1946-1965)

The story of Vertiv begins with **Capitol Refrigeration Industries**, established in 1946 by **Ralph Liebert** (1918-1984) in Columbus, Ohio. Working from his garage, Liebert recognized an emerging problem in the nascent computer industry: traditional HVAC systems were inadequate for the unique cooling needs of computer equipment.

In his garage workshop, Liebert developed the first prototype **precision air conditioner** specifically designed for computer rooms. This innovation addressed a critical need that traditional building cooling systems couldn't solve - maintaining precise temperature and humidity control for sensitive computing equipment.

In early 1965, Liebert introduced his prototype to IBM in Chicago, marking a pivotal moment that would transform his garage project into an industry-defining company.

## The Liebert Corporation Era (1965-1987)

In **1965**, **Liebert Corporation** was officially formed as the industry's first manufacturer of **Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC)** systems. The company started with just five associates but pioneered an entirely new category of precision cooling technology.

Liebert Corporation established itself as the gold standard in data center cooling, creating a brand synonymous with mission-critical cooling infrastructure that persists to this day.

## Emerson Electric Acquisition (1987-2016)

In **1987**, Liebert Corporation was acquired by **Emerson Electric Co.**, becoming part of the industrial conglomerate's expanding technology portfolio.

### Formation of Emerson Network Power (2000)

In **2000**, Emerson consolidated its network and computer protection businesses to form the **Emerson Network Power (ENP)** division, creating a unified platform for critical infrastructure technologies. This business unit brought together multiple acquisitions and technologies under a single brand focused on power distribution, cooling, and infrastructure management for data centers.

For nearly two decades, the Liebert brand operated within Emerson's portfolio, continuing to innovate in precision cooling and expanding into broader critical infrastructure solutions.

## Birth of Vertiv: The Platinum Equity Era (2016-2020)

### The $4 Billion Spin-Out (2016)

In **December 2016**, Emerson Electric made a strategic decision to divest its Network Power division. Private equity firm **Platinum Equity** acquired the business in a transaction valued at over **$4 billion**. Emerson retained a subordinated equity stake in the new entity.

On **December 1, 2016**, the deal closed, and Emerson Network Power began operating as an independent company under a new name: **Vertiv**.

### The Name

The name "Vertiv" was derived from two English words:

- **"Vertex"** - representing the pinnacle or peak
- **"Active"** - representing energy and forward motion

This rebranding marked a fresh start while inheriting the 70+ year engineering legacy of Liebert and Emerson Network Power.

### Building an Independent Company

Under Platinum Equity's ownership, Vertiv operated as a private company for just over three years, focusing on operational improvements and positioning itself for public markets.

## Going Public: The SPAC Merger (2019-2020)
