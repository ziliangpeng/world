# Circle: Core Business Model and Major Revenue Stream

## Executive Summary

Circle is fundamentally a **reserve management company** that earns money by investing customer deposits in ultra-safe, interest-bearing assets. The company derives **96% of its revenue** from interest earned on reserves backing USDC, making it essentially a money market fund with a stablecoin wrapper.

**Key Numbers (Q3 2025):**

- Total Revenue: $740M
- Reserve Income: $711M (96%)
- Other Revenue: $29M (4%)
- USDC Circulation: $73.7B
- Effective Yield: ~4.8% on reserves

## The Core Business Model: USDC Reserve Float

### How Circle Makes Money (The Simple Version)

**The 4-Step Model:**

1. **You give Circle $1 USD**
   - Someone (exchange, institution, individual) deposits $1 with Circle

2. **Circle mints you 1 USDC**
   - You receive 1 USDC token (on blockchain)
   - You can now use USDC anywhere in the crypto ecosystem

3. **Circle invests YOUR dollar**
   - Your $1 goes into ultra-safe, interest-bearing assets
   - Primarily US Treasury bills and money market funds

4. **Circle keeps 100% of the interest**
   - You get to use your USDC (worth $1)
   - Circle earns 4-5% annual interest on your $1
   - You receive: $0 in interest
   - Circle receives: All the yield

**This is the entire business model.**

## The Math: How Much Money Does This Make?

### Current Scale (Q3 2025)

**USDC in Circulation:**

- $73.7 billion

**Average Interest Rate on Reserves:**

- ~4.8% (based on short-term Treasury yields)

**Annual Interest Income (Gross):**

- $73.7B × 4.8% = **~$3.5 billion per year**

**Actual Q3 2025 Numbers:**

- Reserve Income: $711M in Q3
- Annualized: $2.84B per year
- Slightly lower than theoretical max due to:
  - Cash holdings (earn 0%)
  - Time lag in deployment
  - Conservative investment approach

## Revenue Breakdown (Q3 2025)

### Reserve Income: $711M (96% of revenue)

**What generates this:**

- Interest on US Treasury bills: ~$680M
- Interest on overnight repos: ~$25M
- Interest on cash balances: ~$6M

**Key drivers:**

1. **USDC circulation** (volume) - More USDC = more reserves = more interest
2. **Interest rates** (yield) - Higher Fed rates = higher Treasury yields
3. **Reserve composition** (efficiency) - Less idle cash = more earning assets

### Other Revenue: $29M (4% of revenue)

**Sources:**

- Subscription and services revenue
- Transaction revenue (institutional conversions)
- Circle Mint fees (large fiat-to-USDC conversions)

**Note:** These will be covered in detail in a separate document on non-core revenue streams.

## The Economics: Costs and Profitability

### Revenue (Q3 2025 Annualized)

**Gross Revenue:** ~$2.96B per year

- Reserve Income: $2.84B (96%)
- Other Revenue: $116M (4%)

### Major Costs

**1. Distribution Costs: ~60% of revenue**

**2024 Full Year:**

- Revenue: $1.68B
- Distribution costs: $1.01B
- **Distribution as % of revenue: 60%**

**What are distribution costs?**

Circle pays exchanges and partners to promote and distribute USDC:

- **Coinbase:** Revenue share for listing USDC, creating trading pairs
- **Binance:** Revenue share for USDC integration and promotion
- **Other exchanges:** Similar revenue-sharing agreements
- **Payment partners:** Incentives to integrate USDC

**Why so high?**

- Network effects: USDC needs to be everywhere
- Exchanges have pricing power (they control user access)
- Without distribution, USDC circulation doesn't grow
- Competitive pressure (Tether also pays exchanges)

**2. Operating Expenses**

**Breakdown (estimated):**

- Technology and infrastructure: $100-150M
- Compliance and legal: $80-120M
- Personnel (employees): $150-200M
- Marketing and business development: $50-80M
- Professional services (attestations, audits): $20-30M

**Total Operating Expenses: ~$400-500M annually**

### Profitability (Q3 2025)

**Q3 2025 Results:**

- Total Revenue: $740M
- Net Income: $214M
- Net Margin: **28.9%**

**Year-over-year growth:**

- Revenue: +66%
- Net Income: +202% (tripled!)
- EBITDA: +78%

**Adjusted EBITDA:**

- Q3 2025: $166M
- Adjusted EBITDA Margin: **57%**

**Profitability is heavily driven by:**

1. Interest rates (Fed policy)
2. USDC circulation growth
3. Distribution cost management

## Interest Rate Sensitivity: The Biggest Risk

### Circle's Own Disclosure

**"A 1% decrease in interest rates could result in a $441M annual revenue decline."**

This is **massive** interest rate sensitivity.

### Scenario Analysis

**Current State (Q3 2025):**

- USDC: $73.7B
- Rates: ~4.8%
- Revenue: $2.84B
- Net Income: ~$850M (annualized)

**Scenario 1: Rates drop to 3.5% (-1.3%)**

- Revenue impact: -$574M (-20%)
- New revenue: $2.27B
- Net income: ~$400M (-53% decline!)

**Scenario 2: Rates drop to 2.5% (-2.3%)**

- Revenue impact: -$1.01B (-36%)
- New revenue: $1.83B
- Net income: ~$200M (-76% decline!)
- Distribution costs still $1B (fixed)
- Operating expenses still $400M+ (mostly fixed)
- **Profit margin collapses**

**Scenario 3: Rates rise to 6% (+1.2%)**

- Revenue impact: +$529M (+19%)
- New revenue: $3.37B
- Net income: ~$1.5B (+76% gain!)
- **This is what shareholders want**

### The Problem

**Circle cannot control interest rates.**

- Rates set by Federal Reserve
- Circle is a "rate taker" not a "rate maker"
- Zero pricing power
- No ability to hedge or protect revenue

**Fed projections (Sep 2025):**

- 2025: 3.60% (down from ~5%)
- 2026: 3.40%
- 2027: 3.10%
- Long-term neutral: ~2.5-3%

**This is bearish for Circle's revenue.**

## Growth Requirements to Offset Rate Declines

### The Math

To maintain current revenue levels as rates decline, Circle needs **massive USDC circulation growth**.

**Example: Offsetting a 1% rate decline**

- Current: $73.7B at 4.8% = $2.84B revenue
- After rate cut: Need same $2.84B revenue at 3.8%
- Required circulation: $2.84B ÷ 3.8% = **$74.7B**
- Growth needed: **$28B additional USDC (+38%)**

**Circle's own estimates:**

- **25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut:** Need +$3.7B USDC (+6%)
- **200 basis point (2%) rate cut:** Need +$28B USDC (+44%)

### Is This Achievable?

**Bull case (Yes):**

- Q3 2025 YoY growth: **+108%** (incredible!)
- Crypto bull market momentum
- New partnerships (Nubank, MoneyGram, etc.)
- Tether market share capture (regulatory advantage)
- Cross-border payments adoption

**Bear case (No):**

- 108% growth not sustainable long-term
- Heavily dependent on crypto bull market
- If crypto winter returns, circulation could shrink
- Tether remains dominant (2x Circle's size)
- Need 44% growth while rates drop 2% = very difficult

## Historical Performance: The Interest Rate Impact

### 2020-2021: Low Rate Environment

**Fed Funds Rate:** Near 0%
**USDC Circulation:** Growing, but...
**Revenue:** Minimal (USDC earned almost nothing on reserves)
**Profitability:** Struggled, had layoffs
**Result:** First SPAC deal fell through partly due to profitability concerns

### 2022-2024: High Rate Environment

**Fed Funds Rate:** Raised from 0% to 5%+
**USDC Circulation:** Growing rapidly
**Revenue:** Exploded (4-5% on growing reserves)
**Profitability:** Became highly profitable
**Result:** Successfully IPO'd at $6.9B valuation

**Lesson:** Circle's business is fundamentally a bet on interest rates × circulation.

## Why This Model Works (For Now)

### Value Proposition for USDC Holders

**What you give up:**

- Interest on your dollars (4-5% annual yield)

**What you get:**

- **Instant, 24/7 global transfers** (vs 1-5 day bank wires)
- **Crypto trading pairs** (trade any crypto instantly)
- **DeFi access** (earn yield, provide liquidity, borrow/lend)
- **Cross-border payments** (cheaper than Western Union, faster than SWIFT)
- **Dollar exposure** (for people in countries with weak currencies)
- **Programmable money** (smart contract integration)

**For many users, this is worth giving up the interest.**

### Value Proposition for Circle

**What Circle provides:**

- Stable, redeemable digital dollar
- Regulatory compliance and transparency
- 24/7 blockchain-based settlement
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Solana, Base, etc.)

**What Circle gets:**

- Zero-interest deposits
- Invest deposits in 4-5% yielding treasuries
- Keep 100% of the yield
- Extremely high gross margin (95%+)

**This is an incredibly profitable model when rates are high.**

## Comparison to Traditional Finance

### Circle vs Money Market Fund

**Traditional Money Market Fund (Fidelity, Vanguard):**

- You deposit $1
- Fund invests in treasuries
- You earn: 4-5% yield
- Fund keeps: 0.1-0.5% management fee
- **You get 95%+ of the yield**

**Circle (USDC):**

- You deposit $1
- Circle invests in treasuries
- You earn: 0%
- Circle keeps: 100% of yield
- **Circle gets 100% of the yield**

**The tradeoff:**

Money market fund:

- You keep the yield
- But no crypto utility
- Slow redemptions (1-2 days)
- Can't use in DeFi or trading

USDC:

- You give up yield
- But get instant transfers, crypto access, global reach
- Immediate redemptions
- Use in DeFi, trading, payments

### Circle vs Bank

**Traditional Bank:**

- You deposit $1 in checking account
- Bank lends it out at 6-8%
- You earn: 0-0.5% interest
- Bank keeps: 5.5-8% spread
- But: Bank takes credit risk, duration risk

**Circle (USDC):**

- You deposit $1
- Circle invests in risk-free treasuries at 4-5%
- You earn: 0%
- Circle keeps: 4-5% spread
- Zero credit risk, minimal duration risk

**Circle's model is safer and more profitable than banking.**

## The Regulatory Constraint

### Why Circle Can't Invest Aggressively

**What Circle is NOT allowed to do:**

❌ Invest reserves in stocks
❌ Invest in corporate bonds
❌ Invest in real estate
❌ Invest in crypto assets
❌ Lend reserves for yield
❌ Take duration risk (long-term bonds)
❌ Take credit risk (anything below AAA)

**What Circle MUST hold:**

✅ Cash
✅ Short-term US Treasuries (<397 days)
✅ Overnight Treasury repos
✅ That's it.

**Why these restrictions?**

- USDC promises 1:1 redeemability
- Reserves must be liquid (convertible to cash in 24 hours)
- Licensed money transmitter regulations
- Stablecoin reserve requirements (current and proposed)
- Customer protection

**The constraint:**

Circle is limited to earning whatever short-term Treasury rates are. They cannot "juice returns" by taking on more risk.

**This makes them entirely dependent on Fed policy.**

---

## The Competitive Position

### vs Tether (USDT)

**Tether:**

- Circulation: ~$140B (2x Circle)
- Revenue: Estimated $5-7B annually (higher rates)
- Business model: Similar (reserve interest)
- Transparency: Much worse (no full audit, opaque reserves)
- Regulation: Minimal (offshore entity)

**Tether's advantage:**

- First mover, deeply entrenched
- Less regulatory overhead = lower costs
- Willing to operate in gray areas

**Circle's advantage:**

- Regulatory compliance = moat if US regulates stablecoins
- Transparency = institutional trust
- US-based = can work with US banks and institutions

### vs Banks Offering Stablecoins

**JPM Coin, Citi's stablecoin, others:**

- Limited circulation (internal use only)
- Not crypto-native
- Less accessible

**Circle's advantage:**

- Open, permissionless blockchain access
- Multi-chain support
- Crypto-native integrations

## Key Metrics to Watch

### For Investors

**1. USDC Circulation Growth**

- Q3 2025: $73.7B (+108% YoY)
- Target: Sustain 50%+ annual growth
- This is the #1 driver of revenue

**2. Interest Rates**

- Current: ~4.8% on reserves
- Fed projections: Declining to 3% by 2027
- Every 1% drop = -$441M revenue

**3. Reserve Income per $1 of USDC**

- Q3 2025: ~$711M on $73.7B = 3.86% annualized effective rate
- Should track closely with Treasury bill yields

**4. Distribution Costs as % of Revenue**

- 2024: 60%
- If this rises, profitability suffers
- If Circle can negotiate lower (40-50%), margins improve

**5. Net Margin**

- Q3 2025: 28.9%
- Highly dependent on rates and circulation growth
- Will compress if rates fall faster than circulation grows

---

## Investment Thesis Implications

### Bull Case

**Circle is attractive if:**

1. **USDC circulation keeps growing 50%+ annually**
   - Crypto adoption accelerates
   - Cross-border payments scale
   - Tether loses market share to regulation

2. **Interest rates stay elevated (>3.5%)**
   - Fed pauses cuts at 3.5-4%
   - Inflation remains sticky
   - Revenue stays strong

3. **Distribution costs decline**
   - Circle gains pricing power vs exchanges
   - Reduces revenue share from 60% to 40-50%
   - Margins expand significantly

**Outcome:** Revenue grows faster than costs, profitability scales, stock performs well.

### Bear Case

**Circle is unattractive if:**

1. **Interest rates fall to 2.5-3%**
   - Fed cuts aggressively
   - Revenue drops 30-40%
   - Profitability collapses

2. **USDC circulation stagnates or shrinks**
   - Crypto winter returns
   - Trading volume drops
   - No offsetting growth from payments

3. **Distribution costs remain fixed**
   - Still paying 60% to exchanges
   - Fixed ~$1B annual cost
   - Margins compress severely

**Outcome:** Revenue declines, costs are sticky, profitability evaporates, stock underperforms.

### Base Case

**Most likely scenario:**

- Rates decline gradually to 3-3.5% by 2027
- USDC grows 30-50% annually (slower than 2024-2025)
- Distribution costs remain 55-60% of revenue
- Revenue flat to +20% over 2 years
- Net income flat to +10%

**Stock performance:** Mediocre, underperforms growth stocks, similar to low-growth fintech.

---

## Summary

Circle's core business model is elegantly simple but structurally vulnerable:

**The Model:**

- Collect deposits via USDC
- Invest in risk-free treasuries
- Keep 100% of interest
- Pay exchanges to distribute USDC

**Revenue:** 96% from reserve interest income

**Profitability:** High when rates are high, collapses when rates are low

**Growth:** Need massive circulation growth to offset declining rates

**Risk:** Zero control over interest rates (Fed policy determines revenue)

**Opportunity:** If USDC circulation grows fast enough, can offset rate declines and maintain profitability

Circle is fundamentally a **leveraged bet on:**

1. Short-term interest rates (declining = bearish)
2. USDC adoption and circulation growth (accelerating = bullish)
3. The spread between the two

The next 2-3 years will determine whether Circle can successfully transition from a high-margin, rate-dependent float business to a diversified digital financial infrastructure company.

**For now, 96% of revenue comes from one thing: earning interest on customer deposits.**
