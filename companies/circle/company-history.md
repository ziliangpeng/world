## 2023: The SVB Crisis - Major Test of USDC

### Silicon Valley Bank Collapse (March 2023)

**The Crisis:**

- **March 10, 2023:** California regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank

- **March 11, 2023:** USDC lost its $1 peg
- Dropped as low as **$0.81-$0.87** (13-19% decline)
- Panic selling across crypto markets
- Other stablecoins (DAI, FRAX) also depegged due to USDC exposure

**Resolution:**

- **March 13, 2023:** US Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC announced all SVB depositors would be made whole
- Government waived standard $250,000 FDIC insurance limit
- Circle's $3.3 billion was secure
- USDC rapidly **re-pegged to $1** within 48 hours

**Key Takeaways:**

## Strategic Evolution

**Result:** Failed, lost $156M, learned to focus

### Phase 3 (2019-2022): USDC Infrastructure
**Strategy:** Become the regulated, transparent stablecoin leader
**Result:** USDC grew to #2 stablecoin globally

### Phase 4 (2023-Present): Diversified Financial Infrastructure
**Strategy:** USDC + payments network + tokenized assets + cross-border rails
**Result:** In progress - expanding beyond pure stablecoin float model

## Looking Forward

Circle has evolved from a consumer Bitcoin app to the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin in the world. The company survived multiple pivots, a catastrophic banking crisis, and a failed SPAC attempt to finally go public in 2025.

The next chapter will determine whether Circle can:

1. Maintain USDC growth as interest rates decline
2. Diversify revenue beyond reserve interest income
3. Make USDC a true payments rail (not just a trading tool)
4. Compete effectively with Tether's dominant market position
5. Navigate evolving stablecoin regulations globally

Jeremy Allaire's 30+ year vision for digital finance is still unfolding, and Circle is now a public company accountable to shareholders as it pursues that mission.
