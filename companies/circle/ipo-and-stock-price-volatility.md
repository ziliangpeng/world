# Circle (CRCL): IPO and Stock Price Volatility - The Complete Story

## Executive Summary

Circle Internet Group went public on June 5, 2025, in one of the most dramatic IPO stories in recent market history. The stock:

- **IPO Price:** $31 per share
- **First-day close:** $82.84 (+167%)
- **Peak (June 23):** $298.99 (+865% from IPO)
- **Current (Dec 2025):** ~$76-84 (-72% from peak, back near IPO price)

**What happened:** Circle experienced one of the largest IPO "pops" since 1980, surged to nearly $300 on regulatory tailwinds, then crashed back to earth due to insider selling, lockup expirations, and fundamental concerns about profitability in a declining interest rate environment.

**Key lesson:** This is a textbook case of IPO mania driven by crypto enthusiasm and regulatory optimism, followed by a reality check when insiders cashed out and fundamentals reasserted themselves.

## Timeline of Events

### June 5, 2025: IPO Day - The Massive Pop

**IPO Details:**

- **Price:** $31 per share
- **Shares offered:** 34 million
- **Raised:** ~$1.1 billion
- **Company valuation:** $6.9 billion
- **Underwriters:** JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs

**First Day Trading:**

- **Opening:** $69 (+123% from IPO price)
- **High:** $103.75
- **Intraday peak (1:00 PM):** $95
- **Close:** $82.84 (+167%)

**The Underpricing Scandal:**

Circle left **$1.72 billion on the table** — the difference between what they raised at $31 and what the market was willing to pay on day one.

- This ranks as the **7th largest IPO underpricing since 1980**
- Only exceeded by: Visa, Airbnb, Snowflake, Rivian, DoorDash, and Coupang
- The $1.72B left on the table was **nearly 2x Circle's entire cash balance** ($849M) before the IPO

**Why was it so underpriced?**

- Crypto market was surging in Q2 2025
- Institutional demand far exceeded supply
- Conservative pricing by underwriters (possibly to ensure success)
- Pent-up demand after failed 2022 SPAC attempt

**What this means:**

- Great for buyers who got IPO allocation (instant 167% gain)
- Terrible for Circle (they raised $1.1B but could have raised $2.8B at market price)
- Huge windfall for Wall Street firms and their clients

---

### June 5 - June 23: The Meteoric Rise (+865%)

**Stock Performance:**

- June 5 close: $82.84
- June 23 peak: **$298.99**
- Gain: +261% in just 18 days
- Total from IPO: **+865%**

**What drove the surge?**

#### 1. GENIUS Act Passage (June 17, 2025)

**The Catalyst:**

- U.S. Senate passed the **GENIUS Act** (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins)
- Vote: **68-30** (strong bipartisan support)
- First-ever federal framework for stablecoin regulation in the U.S.

**Immediate Impact:**

- Circle stock surged **+34% in one day** (June 17)
- Closed at $199.59
- After-hours high: $211.87
- Continued rallying to $299 over next week

**Why this mattered:**

- Regulatory clarity = legitimacy for USDC
- Federal framework could disadvantage Tether (offshore, opaque)
- Circle positioned as the "compliant stablecoin" winner
- Potential for explosive growth if regulation favors U.S.-licensed issuers

#### 2. Crypto Market Euphoria

- Bitcoin rallying in Q2 2025
- Institutional adoption narratives
- ETF inflows
- Regulatory optimism under new administration

#### 3. FOMO and Momentum Trading

- Retail investors piling in
- "Next Coinbase" narrative
- Short squeeze dynamics
- Meme stock-like behavior

#### 4. Market Cap Nearing Coinbase

By June 23, Circle's market cap approached Coinbase's, despite having:

- Much smaller revenue base
- 96% dependence on interest rates (vs Coinbase's diversified revenue)
- No proven track record as a public company

**This was a massive overvaluation driven by hype.**

---

### August 12-15, 2025: The Secondary Offering - First Major Selloff

**The Announcement:**

Circle announced a **secondary offering of 10 million shares** at $130 per share.

**Details:**

- **Total raised:** $1.4 billion (at $130/share pricing)
- **Source of shares:**
  - 8 million from existing shareholders (insiders/VCs)
  - 2 million from the company
- **Price:** $130 (down from peak of $299, but +320% from IPO)

**Who was selling?**

- **CEO Jeremy Allaire:** 357,812 shares ($45.5M), reducing holdings by 2%
- **IDG Capital:** 1.17 million shares
- **General Catalyst:** 1.12 million shares
- **Fidelity:** ~750,000 shares
- **Oak Investment Partners & Accel:** Both reduced 5% stakes

**Market Reaction:**

- Stock dropped **5% immediately** in after-hours trading
- Continued dropping **6%+ in subsequent sessions**
- Total decline: **~20% from announcement**

**Why did this hurt?**

1. **Dilution:** 10M new shares = existing shareholders own smaller % of company
2. **Signal of low confidence:** If CEO and VCs are selling at $130, why should retail buy?
3. **Supply flood:** 10M shares is significant selling pressure
4. **Timing:** Just 2 months after IPO — looked opportunistic

**The optics were terrible:**

- Insiders bought at $31
- Stock ran to $299
- Insiders sold at $130
- Retail investors left holding the bag

---

### August - November 2025: The Grind Down

**Stock Performance:**

- August high: ~$150
- September: Dropped to ~$110 (-28.1% in the month)
- November: Dropped another **40%** to ~$70s
- Range: Oscillating between $70-$90

**What caused the sustained decline?**

#### 1. Fundamental Concerns

**Interest Rate Risk Re-Emerges:**

- Fed began cutting rates in Q3 2025
- Market realized 96% of Circle's revenue depends on rates
- Every 1% rate cut = $441M revenue loss
- Long-term rate projections: 3-3.5% by 2027 (down from 5%)
- This threatens Circle's profitability

**Q3 Earnings Mixed Signals:**

- Revenue: $740M (+66% YoY) ✅ Strong
- Net income: $214M ✅ Strong
- BUT: Circle **raised operating expense outlook** ❌
- Market interpreted this as margin compression ahead

#### 2. Early Lockup Release (August 13)

**Triggered early release provision:**

- IPMorgan released **11.5 million shares** after stock traded 15% above IPO for 5 days
- Added significant supply to market
- More insider selling: **551,000 shares** sold by insiders in Q3 ($45.6M value)

#### 3. Profit-Taking

- Many investors who bought at $82 (day 1) were up 260% at peak
- Taking profits at $150-200 was rational
- No strong fundamental support for $200+ valuation

#### 4. Crypto Market Cooling

- Bitcoin volatility
- Broader market uncertainty
- Less FOMO/momentum

---

### December 2, 2025: Full Lockup Expiration - Back to IPO Price

**The Event:**

- **180-day lockup period expired** on December 2, 2025
- Standard for IPOs: insiders cannot sell for 180 days

**What unlocked:**

- Potentially **tens of millions of shares** became freely tradable
- Founders, early employees, VC firms all able to sell
- Major overhang on stock

**Market Reaction:**

- Stock trading in **low $70s** by late November (anticipating lockup)
- December 2-3: Stock around **$76-84**
- Essentially **back to IPO opening price** of $69

**Current Status (December 7, 2025):**

- Stock: ~$84
- Down **72% from peak** of $299
- Down **40%+ in November alone**
- Wiped out nearly all post-IPO gains

**Elevated Selling Pressure:**

- Data shows "elevated utilization" (shares being borrowed for short selling)
- High volatility expected
- Comparable to other recent IPO lockup disasters

## The Numbers: IPO Performance Breakdown

### Circle's 18-Day Journey (June 5 - June 23)

| Date | Price | % Change from IPO | Event |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------|
| June 5 (IPO) | $31 | 0% | Priced at $31 |
| June 5 (Open) | $69 | +123% | First trade |
| June 5 (Close) | $82.84 | +167% | End of day 1 |
| June 17 | $199.59 | +544% | GENIUS Act passes Senate |
| June 23 | $298.99 (peak) | +865% | All-time high |
| Aug 12 | ~$150 | +384% | Secondary offering announced |
| Sep (low) | ~$110 | +255% | Post-offering decline |
| Nov (low) | ~$70 | +126% | Pre-lockup selling |
| Dec 2 | ~$76 | +145% | Lockup expires |
| Dec 7 | ~$84 | +171% | Current |

### Total Volatility

- **52-week range:** $64.00 - $298.99
- **Peak to trough:** -75% decline
- **IPO to current:** ~+171% (still positive, but mostly erased)

---

## The $1.72 Billion Left on the Table

### What Does This Mean?

**If Circle had priced at $83 (day 1 close) instead of $31:**

- Would have raised: $2.8 billion (vs $1.1B actual)
- Left on table: **$1.72 billion**

**Context:**

- Circle's pre-IPO cash: $849 million
- They left 2x their cash balance on the table
- This $1.72B ranks **7th largest underpricing since 1980**

**Who benefited?**

- Institutional investors who got IPO allocation
- Wall Street underwriters (earned fees + allocated cheap shares to clients)
- First-day buyers (if they sold at peak)

**Who lost?**

- Circle shareholders (company raised less capital)
- Late buyers (bought at $200-300, now underwater)

### Why Did Underwriters Price So Low?

**Possible reasons:**

1. **Conservative approach:** Ensure IPO success (avoid the "broken IPO")
2. **Reward institutional clients:** Give them instant gains to maintain relationships
3. **Uncertain market:** Crypto volatility made pricing difficult
4. **Failed SPAC precedent:** 2022 SPAC deal fell through, created caution

**Criticism:**

- JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman Sachs clearly underestimated demand
- Circle's management should have pushed for higher price
- $1.72B is an enormous amount to leave on the table

## Insider Selling: The Timeline

### August 2025: Secondary Offering

| Seller | Shares Sold | Value | % of Holdings Sold |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------------------|
| Jeremy Allaire (CEO) | 357,812 | $45.5M | 2% |
| IDG Capital | 1,170,000 | $152M | Partial |
| General Catalyst | 1,120,000 | $146M | Partial |
| Fidelity | 750,000 | $97.5M | Partial |
| Oak Investment Partners | Unknown | Unknown | ~5% |
| Accel | Unknown | Unknown | ~5% |

**Total from secondary:** 10 million shares, $1.4 billion

### Q3 2025: Ongoing Sales

- **551,000 shares** sold by insiders
- Value: **$45.6 million**
- Included sales by director Rajeev Date

### December 2025: Post-Lockup

- Lockup expired December 2
- Selling pressure ongoing
- Exact volume unknown but significant

**Pattern:**

- Insiders bought at seed/Series rounds: likely $1-10/share
- IPO at $31: already 3-30x gains
- Selling at $130-200: 13-200x gains
- Even at $70: 7-70x gains for early investors

**For early investors, ANY price above $31 is a win.**

## What Drove the Stock Movements: A Deeper Analysis

### The Surge: June 5-23 (+865%)

**Fundamental drivers (20%):**

- GENIUS Act regulatory clarity
- Strong Q2 2025 financials
- USDC circulation growth (+108% YoY)
- Crypto market momentum

**Speculative drivers (80%):**

- FOMO (fear of missing out)
- "Next Coinbase" narrative
- Retail investor piling in
- Momentum/technical trading
- Short squeeze dynamics
- Low float (limited shares available)

**Valuation at peak ($299):**

- Market cap: ~$51 billion (based on 170M shares outstanding)
- Revenue (Q3 annualized): ~$2.96B
- **Price-to-Sales ratio: ~17x**

**Comparison:**

- Coinbase P/S: ~5-8x
- PayPal P/S: ~2-3x
- Visa P/S: ~10-12x

**Circle at $299 was trading like a high-growth tech stock, despite 96% of revenue being dependent on interest rates (essentially a money market fund).**

### The Crash: June 23 - December 2 (-72%)

**Fundamental drivers (60%):**

- Interest rate concerns (Fed cutting rates)
- Operating expense increase (margin compression)
- Revenue model risk (96% from reserves)
- Competition from Tether (still 2x larger)

**Technical/supply drivers (40%):**

- Insider selling (secondary offering)
- Lockup expirations
- Profit-taking
- Short selling

**Valuation at $76:**

- Market cap: ~$13 billion
- Revenue (Q3 annualized): ~$2.96B
- **Price-to-Sales ratio: ~4.4x**

This is much more reasonable, comparable to fintech peers.

## Lessons and Takeaways

### For Circle

**What went right:**

- Successfully went public after failed 2022 SPAC
- Raised $1.1B in IPO + $1.4B in secondary = $2.5B total capital
- Established public market presence
- Benefited from crypto/regulatory momentum

**What went wrong:**

- Left $1.72B on the table due to underpricing
- Insider selling created terrible optics
- Stock collapse damaged retail investor trust
- Valuation now back to earth, hard to raise capital at premium

### For Investors

**Winners:**

- IPO allocation recipients (instant 167% gain)
- Early sellers (sold at $200-299)
- Short sellers (from peak to now)

**Losers:**

- Late buyers (bought at $150-299, now underwater)
- Long-term holders expecting sustained growth

**Lessons:**

1. **IPO pops are often temporary** - First-day surges rarely last
2. **Watch insider selling** - When CEO sells 2 months after IPO, be cautious
3. **Understand the business** - Circle is 96% interest rate dependent, not a growth tech stock
4. **Lockup expirations matter** - December 2 lockup was telegraphed, caused sustained selling
5. **Regulatory catalysts are temporary** - GENIUS Act drove stock to $299, but fundamentals matter more
6. **Valuation matters** - 17x P/S for a rate-dependent business was insane

### For the Market

**This is a textbook case of:**

- IPO mania
- Crypto hype cycle
- Regulatory catalyst overreaction
- Insider enrichment at retail expense
- Reversion to fundamentals

**Circle's story mirrors:**

- Coinbase IPO (April 2021): Peaked at $429, crashed to $40 in bear market
- Robinhood IPO (July 2021): $70 IPO, hit $85, crashed to $8
- Other crypto-adjacent IPOs that surged then collapsed

---

## Current State and Outlook (December 2025)

### Stock Metrics

- **Price:** ~$84
- **52-week high:** $298.99
- **52-week low:** $64.00
- **% from peak:** -72%
- **% from IPO:** +171%

### Analyst Ratings

- **Firms rating:** 17-18 analysts
- **Consensus:** "Buy"
- **12-month price target:** $138-145
- **Implied upside:** +61-93% from current price

**But:**

- Many of these analysts are from underwriting banks (conflict of interest)
- Targets set when stock was higher, may be revised down
- Fundamental concerns remain (interest rates)

### Bull Case for Recovery

**If you believe Circle will recover to $150+:**

1. **USDC growth accelerates** (capture Tether market share)
2. **Interest rates stabilize** at 3.5-4% (not falling to 2.5%)
3. **Revenue diversification succeeds** (CPN, USYC, Circle Mint grow to 20%+ of revenue)
4. **Crypto bull market continues** (more trading volume = more USDC demand)
5. **Regulatory advantage** (GENIUS Act hurts Tether, helps Circle)

### Bear Case for Further Decline

**If you believe Circle will drop to $50-60:**

1. **Interest rates fall to 2.5%** (Fed cuts aggressively)
2. **USDC circulation stagnates** (crypto winter returns)
3. **Operating expenses grow faster than revenue** (margin compression)
4. **Tether remains dominant** (Circle can't close gap)
5. **Continued insider selling** (lockup expiration overhang for months)

### Base Case: Range-Bound $70-100

**Most likely scenario:**

- Stock oscillates between $70-100 for 6-12 months
- Gradual decline in interest rates offset by moderate USDC growth
- Revenue grows 10-20%, but margins compress
- Stock trades at 4-5x P/S (fintech valuation, not tech)
- Slow grind, not explosive growth

## Comparisons to Other IPOs

### Similar Trajectories

| Company | IPO Date | IPO Price | First Day Close | Peak | Current (or Trough) | Peak to Trough |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------------|------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Circle (CRCL)** | Jun 2025 | $31 | $82.84 (+167%) | $298.99 | $84 (-72%) | -72% |
| Coinbase (COIN) | Apr 2021 | $381 (ref) | $328 | $429 | $40 (low) | -91% |
| Robinhood (HOOD) | Jul 2021 | $38 | $34.82 | $85 | $8 (low) | -91% |
| Snowflake (SNOW) | Sep 2020 | $120 | $253 (+111%) | $429 | $116 (low) | -73% |
| Rivian (RIVN) | Nov 2021 | $78 | $100 | $179 | $10 (low) | -94% |

**Pattern:**

- Big IPO pops (often 100%+ first day)
- Surge to euphoric peak within weeks/months
- Crash 70-90% from peak as fundamentals reassert
- Long recovery period (if ever)

**Circle fits this pattern perfectly.**

### What Made Circle Different

**Unique to Circle:**

1. **$1.72B left on table** - 7th largest underpricing ever
2. **Regulatory catalyst** - GENIUS Act drove 34% single-day surge
3. **Insider selling 2 months after IPO** - Extremely fast secondary offering
4. **Interest rate dependency** - Unlike other tech IPOs, Circle is a quasi-financial stock

## The Bottom Line: What Really Happened

### The Story in One Paragraph

Circle went public at $31, immediately surged to $83 on first-day hype, then rocketed to $299 when the U.S. Senate passed stablecoin regulation. This created euphoria among retail investors who saw Circle as the "compliant winner" in crypto. But the fundamentals didn't support a $51B valuation for a company earning $2.96B revenue (mostly from interest rates). Insiders knew this, so they sold $1.4B of stock at $130 in August. As interest rates began falling and operating expenses rose, the market realized Circle's profitability was at risk. The stock crashed 72% from peak, wiping out nearly all gains, and now trades near its IPO opening price. The lockup expiration in December added further selling pressure. Circle's IPO is a cautionary tale of hype, insider enrichment, and the harsh reality of fundamentals.

### Who Made Money

**Big winners:**

- IPO allocation recipients (instant 167% if sold)
- Insiders who sold at $130-200 (10-200x returns from seed rounds)
- Wall Street underwriters (fees + cheap shares for clients)
- Short sellers from peak

**Modest winners:**

- First-day buyers who sold at $150-200 range
- Those who bought in $60-70 range and sold at $80-90

**Losers:**

- Anyone who bought at $150-299 (underwater)
- Circle itself (left $1.72B on table)
- Long-term retail holders expecting sustained growth

### Investment Thesis Today

**At $84, is Circle a buy?**

**Yes, if:**

- You believe crypto bull market continues
- USDC can grow 50%+ annually
- Interest rates stabilize at 3.5-4%
- Circle diversifies revenue successfully
- Regulatory advantage plays out

**No, if:**

- You think interest rates fall to 2.5%
- Crypto winter returns (circulation shrinks)
- Tether maintains dominance
- You don't trust management after insider selling
- You see better risk/reward elsewhere

**Fair value estimate:** $80-120 range (4-6x P/S on $2.5-3B revenue)

Circle is no longer a "get rich quick" IPO pop story. It's now a fundamental play on stablecoin adoption vs. interest rate risk. The hype is gone. Now it's about the numbers.
