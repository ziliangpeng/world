# Circle: Revenue Diversification and Future Opportunities

## Executive Summary

Circle currently derives only **4% of revenue** from non-reserve sources ($29M of $740M in Q3 2025). However, the company is actively building multiple new revenue streams to reduce dependency on interest rate-driven reserve income.

**Strategic Imperative:** As interest rates decline from ~5% to projected 3% by 2027, Circle must diversify revenue or face a potential 30-40% revenue decline.

**Current Non-Reserve Revenue (Q3 2025):** $29M quarterly (~$116M annualized)

**Potential Future State (2027-2028):** $500M-$1B+ from diversified sources

## Product 1: Circle Mint (Institutional On/Off-Ramp)

### What It Is

Circle Mint is the institutional gateway for converting fiat currency (USD, EUR, BRL, MXN) to USDC and back.

**Launched:** 2018 (Circle's longest-running product after USDC itself)

**Target Customers:**

- Crypto exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, etc.)
- Institutional traders and hedge funds
- Banks and financial institutions
- Payment companies
- Consumer app companies (neobanks, wallets)
- Corporate treasuries

### How It Works

**Minting USDC:**

1. Institution wires USD to Circle
2. Circle receives funds (same day or next day)
3. Circle mints USDC 1:1
4. USDC delivered to institution's blockchain address
5. **Instant and automatic conversion**

**Redeeming USDC:**

1. Institution sends USDC to Circle
2. Circle burns the USDC
3. Circle wires USD back to institution (same day or next day)
4. **1:1 redemption guaranteed**

**Supported Currencies:**

- USD (primary)
- EUR (via EURC)
- BRL (Brazilian Real) - via PIX integration
- MXN (Mexican Peso) - via SPEI integration

**Coverage:** 185 countries

### Current Scale

**Public Metrics:**

- Operating since 2018
- "Key institutional onramp to USDC and EURC"
- Used by major exchanges for liquidity management

**Estimated Metrics:**

- Likely processes $50-100B+ annually in conversions
- Used by 100+ institutional clients
- Critical infrastructure for USDC ecosystem

### Revenue Model

**Fee Structure (estimated based on industry standards):**

**Small institutions ($1M-$10M monthly):**

- 0.1-0.3% on conversions
- Monthly subscription: $500-$2,000

**Medium institutions ($10M-$100M monthly):**

- 0.05-0.15% on conversions
- Monthly subscription: $2,000-$10,000
- Custom API access

**Large institutions ($100M+ monthly):**

- 0.01-0.05% on conversions
- Monthly subscription: $10,000-$50,000
- Dedicated support, custom integration
- May have revenue-share arrangements

**Example Revenue Calculation:**

- Institution processes $1B monthly via Circle Mint
- Fee: 0.05% = $500,000/month
- Subscription: $20,000/month
- **Total: $520k/month = $6.24M/year from one client**

### Current Revenue Estimate

**Conservative Estimate:**

- Assume $50B annual volume through Circle Mint
- Average fee: 0.08%
- Transaction revenue: $40M/year
- Subscription revenue: $10-20M/year
- **Total: $50-60M annually**

This likely represents the majority of the current $116M "Other Revenue" run rate.

### Future Opportunity

**Bullish Scenario (2027):**

**Volume Growth:**

- Cross-border payments adoption increases
- More banks and fintechs integrate USDC
- Annual volume: $200B (4x growth)

**Revenue Impact:**

- Transaction fees: $160M (at 0.08%)
- Subscriptions: $30-40M
- **Total: $190-200M annually**

**Very Bullish Scenario (2030):**

- USDC becomes standard for cross-border B2B payments
- Annual volume: $500B
- Revenue: $400-500M

**Key Growth Drivers:**

- ✅ Already operational and proven
- ✅ Growing demand from institutions
- ✅ Network effects (more institutions = more utility)
- ⚠️ Fee compression risk (competition from banks, other stablecoins)
- ⚠️ Limited to institutions (not consumer-facing)

## Product 2: Circle Payments Network (CPN)

### What It Is

Circle Payments Network is a **bank settlement network** that allows financial institutions to settle payments using USDC as the underlying rail, while customers see local currency.

**Think of it as:** SWIFT, but using USDC/blockchain for instant settlement instead of correspondent banking.

**Launched:** 2024 (still early stage)

### How It Works

**Example: Business in Mexico pays supplier in Brazil**

**Traditional (SWIFT):**

1. Mexican business initiates payment in MXN
2. Mexican bank converts MXN → USD (3-5% spread)
3. Correspondent bank network (2-3 intermediaries)
4. Brazilian bank converts USD → BRL (3-5% spread)
5. Supplier receives BRL
6. **Time: 3-5 business days**
7. **Cost: 5-10% in fees**

**With Circle Payments Network:**

1. Mexican business initiates payment in MXN
2. Mexican bank (CPN member) converts MXN → USDC
3. USDC transferred on blockchain (2-10 minutes)
4. Brazilian bank (CPN member) converts USDC → BRL
5. Supplier receives BRL
6. **Time: Minutes to hours**
7. **Cost: 0.5-2% in fees**

**Key difference:** Banks settle with each other using USDC, but customers never see crypto.

### Current Scale

**Status (as of Q3 2025):**

- **8 countries** with active flows
- **29 financial institutions** enrolled
- **55 institutions** in eligibility review
- **500 institutions** in pipeline
- **$3.4B annualized transaction volume** (based on trailing 30 days as of Nov 7, 2025)

**Translation:** Very early stage, but growing rapidly.

### Revenue Model

**Potential Fee Structure:**

Circle could charge fees at multiple levels:

**1. Network Membership Fee:**

- Bank joins CPN: $50k-$200k annually
- 29 banks × $100k average = **$2.9M/year**

**2. Transaction Fees:**

- 0.1-0.5% on payment volume
- $3.4B volume × 0.2% = **$6.8M/year currently**

**3. FX Conversion Fees:**

- When Circle facilitates MXN ↔ USDC ↔ BRL conversion
- 0.3-0.5% spread
- Depends on whether banks do their own conversion

**Current Estimated Revenue: $5-10M annually**

### Future Opportunity

**2027 Scenario (Conservative):**

- 100 banks enrolled (from 29 today)
- $50B annual volume (from $3.4B today)
- Fee: 0.2% average

**Revenue Projection:**

- Membership fees: $10M
- Transaction fees: $100M
- FX facilitation: $50M
- **Total: $160M annually**

**2030 Scenario (Bullish):**

- 500+ banks globally
- $500B annual volume
- Circle becomes "Visa/Mastercard of blockchain payments"

**Revenue Projection:**

- Membership fees: $50M
- Transaction fees: $1B
- FX facilitation: $250M
- **Total: $1.3B annually**

**2030 Scenario (Very Bullish - "SWIFT Replacement"):**

- SWIFT handles ~$5 trillion daily = $1,250 trillion annually
- If CPN captures just 1% of cross-border payments: $12.5 trillion
- At 0.1% fee: **$12.5B annual revenue**

### Key Success Factors

**✅ Advantages:**

- Instant settlement (minutes vs days)
- Lower costs (0.5-2% vs 5-10%)
- 24/7 operation (vs banking hours)
- Transparent tracking (blockchain-based)
- Works with existing banking infrastructure

**❌ Challenges:**

- Banks move slowly (regulatory, legacy tech)
- Need critical mass (500 banks in pipeline, only 29 enrolled)
- Competition (Ripple, Stellar, other blockchain networks)
- Currency controls in some countries
- Regulatory approval in each jurisdiction

**⚠️ Timeline Risk:**

- Currently $3.4B volume (tiny)
- Need 10-100x growth to be meaningful
- Will take 3-5 years to scale

**Verdict:** Huge potential ($100M-$1B+ revenue by 2030), but very early and unproven.

## Product 3: USYC (Tokenized Treasury Fund)

### What It Is

USYC is a **tokenized money market fund** that holds short-term US Treasuries and government securities. It's essentially "USDC that pays interest."

**Acquired:** January 2025 (via Hashnote acquisition)

**Target:** Non-US institutional investors only

**Current AUM:** ~$1.5B (as of Jan 2025, largest tokenized treasury fund globally)

### How It Works

**Structure:**

- Each USYC token = 1 share of Hashnote International Short Duration Fund Ltd.
- Fund invests in short-term US government securities
- Yield accrues through **rising token price** (not staking/claiming)
- Redeemable 24/7 into USDC (near-instant redemption)

**Example:**

- You buy 1,000 USYC tokens at $1.00 each = $1,000
- Fund earns 4.5% annually on treasuries
- After 1 year: Each USYC token worth $1.045
- You now have 1,000 × $1.045 = $1,045 value
- **You earned $45 in yield** (4.5%)

**Redeem anytime:**

- Burn USYC → Receive USDC instantly
- USDC → Fiat (if needed)

### Current Scale

**AUM:** $1.5B

**Growth:**

- Grew ~200% from June 2025 to September 2025
- Reached $1B in Q3 2025
- Now ~$1.5B

**Target Market:**

- Non-US institutions (US investors not allowed)
- Corporate treasuries
- Hedge funds
- Family offices
- DeFi protocols wanting yield on stablecoins

### Revenue Model

**Money Market Fund Fee Structure:**

Typical management fee: **0.15-0.50% of AUM annually**

**Current Revenue Estimate:**

- AUM: $1.5B
- Management fee: 0.25% (estimated)
- **Annual revenue: $3.75M**

**Note:** This is tiny compared to Circle's $2.8B reserve income, but it's incremental.

### Future Opportunity

**2027 Scenario (Conservative):**

- AUM grows to $10B (institutions adopt for treasury yield)
- Management fee: 0.2%
- **Annual revenue: $20M**

**2030 Scenario (Bullish):**

- AUM grows to $50B (becomes standard for institutional cash management)
- Management fee: 0.15%
- **Annual revenue: $75M**

**2030 Scenario (Very Bullish):**

- AUM grows to $100B+ (major adoption by corporations and institutions)
- Circle integrates USYC ↔ USDC seamlessly
- Users can hold "yielding USDC" without complexity
- **Annual revenue: $150-200M**

### Strategic Value Beyond Revenue

**The Real Goal: Interest-Bearing USDC**

Circle's vision: **"Seamless access between TMMF collateral and USDC"**

**What this means:**

Currently:

- USDC: No yield, full liquidity
- USYC: Yield, 24/7 redemption into USDC

Future integrated product:

- One wallet, automatic yield optimization
- Idle USDC → Automatically sweeps into USYC (earns yield)
- Need USDC for payment? → Instantly converts from USYC
- **Result: User gets yield + liquidity**

**This is similar to:**

- Bank checking account with automatic savings sweep
- Money market fund with checkwriting privileges
- Robinhood's cash sweep into money market

**If successful:**

- Addresses the "why give up 4-5% yield?" objection
- Makes USDC more attractive vs competitors
- Could accelerate USDC adoption significantly

**Revenue impact:** Modest direct revenue ($20-200M), but could drive $100B+ additional USDC circulation (= $3-5B reserve income).

### Key Challenges

**❌ Regulatory restrictions:**

- US investors cannot use USYC
- Limits addressable market
- Complex compliance requirements

**❌ Competition:**

- BlackRock's BUIDL fund (~$2B AUM)
- Franklin Templeton's BENJI
- Ondo Finance
- Multiple tokenized treasury products launching

**❌ Still early:**

- Total tokenized treasury market: ~$6B
- Tiny compared to $6 trillion money market fund industry
- Will take years to scale

**Verdict:** Small revenue contributor today ($4M), moderate opportunity by 2030 ($75-200M), but strategically important for USDC differentiation.

## Product 4: CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol)

### What It Is

CCTP is **infrastructure for moving USDC between different blockchains** (Ethereum, Solana, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.).

**Think of it as:** The "bridge" that lets USDC flow natively across chains without wrapped tokens or liquidity pools.

**Launched:** 2023
**Upgraded to V2:** March 2025

### How It Works

**Traditional Bridge (Pre-CCTP):**

1. You have 1000 USDC on Ethereum
2. Want to move to Solana
3. Bridge locks your Ethereum USDC
4. Bridge mints "wrapped USDC" on Solana
5. Now you have wrapped USDC (different token, potential risks)
6. **Time: 13-19 minutes**
7. **Issues:** Fragmented liquidity, security risks, complexity

**With CCTP:**

1. You have 1000 USDC on Ethereum
2. Want to move to Solana
3. CCTP **burns** 1000 USDC on Ethereum (destroyed)
4. CCTP **mints** 1000 USDC on Solana (created fresh)
5. You have native USDC on Solana
6. **Time: Seconds** (with CCTP V2 Fast Transfer)
7. **No wrapped tokens, native USDC on every chain**

**CCTP V2 Features (launched March 2025):**

- **Fast Transfer:** Near-instant (seconds vs 13-19 minutes)
- **Hooks:** Automatic actions on destination chain (swap, deposit, etc.)
- Example: Bridge USDC from Ethereum to Solana + automatically swap for SOL

### Current Scale

**Metrics:**

- $36B+ in transaction volume since 2023 launch
- Supported chains: 8+ (Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, etc.)
- Used by wallets, exchanges, DeFi protocols

**Growth:**

- Accelerating adoption
- Base (Coinbase L2) alone: $562B annual USDC volume
- Critical infrastructure for multi-chain DeFi

### Current Revenue Model

**Today: FREE (no fees)**

Circle does NOT charge for CCTP usage. It's infrastructure to make USDC more useful.

**Why free?**

- Increases USDC utility (more chains = more use cases)
- Drives USDC circulation growth
- Network effect: USDC becomes standard cross-chain

**Users only pay:**

- Gas fees on source chain (e.g., Ethereum gas)
- Gas fees on destination chain (e.g., Solana gas)
- These go to validators, not Circle

**Current Revenue: $0**

### Future Monetization Opportunities

**Option 1: Transaction Fees (Low Probability)**

- Charge 0.01-0.05% per cross-chain transfer
- $36B volume × 0.03% = **$10.8M annually**

**Why unlikely:**

- Would slow adoption
- Competitors could offer free bridges
- Circle benefits more from free infrastructure driving USDC growth

**Option 2: Premium Features (Medium Probability)**

- Basic CCTP: Free
- Fast Transfer with Hooks: 0.01-0.02% fee
- Enterprise API access: Subscription fee
- Potential revenue: **$5-10M annually**

**Option 3: Indirect Monetization (Most Likely)**

Circle keeps CCTP free but monetizes the growth it enables:

**Impact:**

- CCTP makes USDC accessible on 10+ chains
- DeFi protocols use USDC more (easy cross-chain movement)
- USDC circulation grows faster
- More reserve income

**Example:**

- CCTP enables $100B additional USDC circulation
- Reserve income at 3.5%: **$3.5B annually**
- CCTP revenue: $0 direct
- Circle revenue: $3.5B indirect

### Future Outlook

**2027 Scenario:**

- Direct revenue: $0-10M (likely stays free or minimal fees)
- Indirect impact: +$50-100B USDC circulation
- Indirect revenue: +$1.5-3.5B reserve income

**Strategic Value:**

CCTP is **infrastructure, not a product**. It's like TCP/IP for USDC movement.

Circle's goal: Make USDC the native stablecoin across all major blockchains.

**Verdict:** Minimal direct revenue, massive strategic value. Enables the multi-chain future that drives USDC adoption.

---

## Product 5: EURC (Euro Stablecoin)

### What It Is

EURC is Circle's **euro-backed stablecoin**. Same model as USDC, but 1 EURC = 1 Euro.

**Launched:** 2022

**Target Market:**

- European businesses and consumers
- Cross-border EUR payments
- EU-based crypto traders
- Global businesses operating in EUR

### Current Scale

**Circulation:** Estimated $50-100M (tiny compared to USDC's $73.7B)

**Status:** Very early stage, minimal adoption

### Revenue Model

**Same as USDC:**

- Earn interest on EUR reserves
- European Central Bank (ECB) deposit rate: Currently ~3.5%
- Revenue = EUR circulation × ECB rate

**Current Revenue Estimate:**

- $75M circulation × 3.5% = **$2.6M annually**

**Negligible.**

### Future Opportunity

**2027 Scenario (Conservative):**

- EUR circulation grows to $5B (European crypto adoption)
- ECB rate: 2.5%
- **Revenue: $125M annually**

**2030 Scenario (Bullish):**

- EUR circulation grows to $30B (becomes standard EUR stablecoin)
- ECB rate: 2.5%
- **Revenue: $750M annually**

**2030 Scenario (Very Bullish):**

- EUR circulation grows to $100B (EURC captures significant European market)
- ECB rate: 3%
- **Revenue: $3B annually**

### Key Challenges

**❌ European regulations:**

- MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation
- Complex compliance requirements
- May favor EU-based issuers

**❌ Limited crypto adoption in Europe:**

- Europe less crypto-native than US, Asia, Latin America
- Strong banking infrastructure (SEPA already instant and cheap)
- Less need for crypto rails

**❌ Competition:**

- Tether's EURT
- Other euro stablecoins
- CBDCs (digital euro in development)

**✅ Opportunities:**

- Cross-border EUR payments (EU ↔ non-EU)
- B2B payments in EUR
- DeFi in Europe (growing)

**Verdict:** Tiny today ($2-3M revenue), moderate potential by 2030 ($125-750M), but lower priority than USDC growth.

---

## Product 6: Additional Stablecoins (Future)

### Other Fiat Stablecoins

Circle could launch stablecoins for other major currencies:

**Potential Candidates:**

- **GBP** (British Pound) - UK market
- **JPY** (Japanese Yen) - Asian market
- **BRL** (Brazilian Real) - Latin America (already partnered via Nubank)
- **MXN** (Mexican Peso) - Latin America
- **SGD** (Singapore Dollar) - Asia-Pacific

### Revenue Potential

**Each successful stablecoin = new reserve income stream**

**Example: GBP stablecoin (2030)**

- Adoption: $10B circulation
- Bank of England rate: 3%
- **Revenue: $300M annually**

**If Circle launches 5 additional currency stablecoins:**

- Total circulation: $50B across currencies
- Average rate: 3%
- **Revenue: $1.5B annually**

### Challenges

**Each currency requires:**

- Regulatory approval in that country
- Banking relationships
- Compliance infrastructure
- Local partnerships
- Market education

**This is HARD and SLOW.**

**Verdict:** Long-term opportunity (2030+), could add $500M-$2B revenue, but requires significant investment and time.

---

## Product 7: Programmable Wallets & Infrastructure

### What It Is

Circle offers **Wallet-as-a-Service** and developer infrastructure for companies to integrate USDC.

**Products:**

- Programmable Wallets API
- Smart Contract Platform
- Gas Station (sponsor transaction fees for users)
- Web3 Services

**Target Customers:**

- Fintech apps wanting crypto integration
- Gaming companies (in-game currencies, NFT marketplaces)
- E-commerce platforms
- Social apps

### Revenue Model

**SaaS Pricing:**

- API access: $100-$1,000/month subscription
- Transaction fees: $0.01-$0.05 per wallet operation
- Gas sponsorship: Circle charges markup on gas fees

**Current Revenue Estimate:** $5-10M annually (small contributor to "Other Revenue")

### Future Opportunity

**2027 Scenario:**

- 1,000 companies using Circle's wallet infrastructure
- Average $50k/year per customer
- **Revenue: $50M annually**

**2030 Scenario:**

- 10,000 companies integrated
- Average $100k/year
- **Revenue: $1B annually**

**Comparable:** Stripe generates $20B+ revenue from payment infrastructure. If Circle becomes "Stripe for crypto payments," the opportunity is massive.

### Challenges

**❌ Competition:**

- Coinbase Wallet-as-a-Service
- MetaMask institutional
- Fireblocks, BitGo
- Many alternatives

**✅ Advantages:**

- Tight integration with USDC
- Circle's regulatory standing
- Full-stack offering

**Verdict:** Moderate near-term ($50M by 2027), large long-term potential ($500M-$1B by 2030) if crypto payments scale.

---

## Future Product: Arc (Circle's Blockchain)

### What It Is

Circle is building **Arc**, its own blockchain network optimized for USDC and financial applications.

**Announced:** 2025

**Vision:** Native blockchain for global finance, with USDC as the native currency.

### Potential Revenue Models

**1. Transaction Fees:**

- Users pay fees to use Arc network
- Fees paid in USDC
- Circle captures portion of fees

**2. Validator Services:**

- Circle runs validators
- Earns staking rewards / block rewards

**3. Ecosystem Development:**

- Attract DeFi protocols, apps to build on Arc
- Circle takes % of economic activity

**Comparable:** Ethereum generates $1-5B annually in transaction fees.

### Timeline and Uncertainty

**Status:** Early development, no launch date

**Revenue:** $0 currently

**Future Potential (2028-2030):**

- If Arc gains traction: $100M-$500M annually
- If Arc fails: $0

**Verdict:** High uncertainty, long timeline, potentially large but unproven.

| **TOTAL** | **$4.0B** | **100%** |

**Diversification Progress:** Non-reserve revenue grows from 3% → 11%

**Still heavily rate-dependent, but improving.**

---

### 2030 Projection (Bullish)

| Revenue Source | Projected Annual | % of Total |
|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Reserve Income (at 3%, $200B USDC) | $6,000M | 55% |
| Circle Mint | $400M | 4% |
| CPN | $1,000M | 9% |

| **TOTAL** | **$10.9B** | **100%** |

**Diversification Success:** Non-reserve revenue reaches 37% of total

**Much more resilient to interest rate changes.**

---

### 2030 Projection (Bear - Failed Diversification)

| Revenue Source | Projected Annual | % of Total |
|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Reserve Income (at 2.5%, $80B USDC) | $2,000M | 91% |
| Circle Mint | $100M | 5% |
| CPN | $50M | 2% |
| Other | $50M | 2% |
| **Total Non-Reserve** | **$200M** | **9%** |
| **TOTAL** | **$2.2B** | **100%** |

**Failed Diversification:** Revenue actually DECLINES from 2025 peak

**Still 91% dependent on reserve income at much lower rates.**

---

## Investment Thesis Implications

### Bull Case (Diversification Succeeds)

**By 2030:**

- Non-reserve revenue: $4B+ (37% of total)
- Total revenue: $11B
- Less dependent on interest rates
- Multiple growth vectors
- Premium valuation (25-30x earnings)

**Stock performance:** Excellent (3-5x from 2025)

### Base Case (Partial Diversification)

**By 2030:**

- Non-reserve revenue: $1-2B (20-25% of total)
- Total revenue: $6-7B
- Still significantly rate-dependent
- Moderate growth
- Mid-tier valuation (15-20x earnings)

**Stock performance:** Moderate (1.5-2x from 2025)

### Bear Case (Diversification Fails)

**By 2030:**

- Non-reserve revenue: $200-500M (10-15% of total)
- Total revenue: $2-3B (declining from 2025)
- Heavily rate-dependent
- Structural decline as rates normalize
- Low valuation (8-12x earnings)

**Stock performance:** Poor (0.5-1x from 2025, potential decline)

## Timeline and Milestones to Watch

### 2025-2026 (Critical Period)

**Q4 2025:**

- CPN enrollment: Should reach 50+ banks
- CPN volume: Should exceed $10B annually
- USYC AUM: Should exceed $2B

**Q2 2026:**

- Circle Mint volume: Should reach $100B annually
- EURC circulation: Should exceed $1B
- Non-reserve revenue: Should reach $150M+ quarterly

**Q4 2026:**

- CPN enrollment: Should reach 100+ banks
- CPN volume: Should exceed $50B annually
- Non-reserve revenue: Should reach 15%+ of total

**If these milestones are NOT met:**

- Diversification strategy is failing
- Circle remains rate-dependent
- Bearish signal for stock

## Conclusion

Circle has **significant opportunities** to diversify beyond reserve interest income, but execution is far from certain.

**Current reality (2025):**

- 96% dependent on interest rates
- $72M in non-reserve revenue
- Very early stage products

**Best-case future (2030):**

- 37% diversified revenue
- $4B+ in non-reserve revenue
- Resilient, multi-product company

**Most likely scenario:**

- 20-25% diversified revenue by 2030
- $1-2B in non-reserve revenue
- Partially de-risked, but still rate-sensitive

**The next 2-3 years (2025-2027) are critical.** Circle must prove that:

1. CPN can scale to hundreds of banks
2. USDC payments can go mainstream (not just trading)
3. USYC can reach $10B+ AUM
4. EURC and multi-currency can gain traction
5. Infrastructure products can generate meaningful revenue

**If they succeed:** Circle becomes a diversified fintech giant worth $20-50B+

**If they fail:** Circle remains a high-margin but rate-dependent stablecoin issuer worth $5-10B

The opportunity is there. Execution will determine the outcome.
